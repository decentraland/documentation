Decentraland is a virtual world owned by its users, developed in the open and ready to grow with
the contributions of people all around the globe.

This documentation details the Decentraland open protocol, everything from the architectural
overview to the specific capabilities of each component. Here you'll find the resources
you need to:

1. Design products and applications in the ecosystem
2. Conduct research and investigate the contents of the world
3. Create your own World Explorer
4. Pursue novel ideas that may end up in this list

**Let's build the metaverse together!**

## Where to start?

If you don't know where to begin, it's a good idea to look at the [architecture]({{< relref "architecture" >}}) of the Decentraland protocol, to learn about the different components and their general purpose before diving into more detailed sections.
