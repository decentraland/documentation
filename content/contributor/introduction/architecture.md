The general architecture of Decentraland can be divided into three main components:

- [The Catalyst network](#catalyst): distributed peer servers that host content and provide the core APIs.
- [The World Explorer](#explorer): app for players to log into Decentraland and explore the land.
- [The CLI](#cli): a command-line interface for creators to develop and deploy content.

The interactive diagram below captures the most important sub-components of the protocol, and can take you to the relevant documentation to learn more.

## Catalyst {#catalyst}

A Catalyst is a node in the Decentraland network that provides an array of different services, including access to content, peer-to-peer communications, blockchain inspection and various utility endpoints.

You can inspect the state of the network using the [Catalyst Monitor](https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-monitor), and host your own node by becoming a [Catalyst owner](https://github.com/decentraland/catalyst-owner).

**Subsystems:**

- [Content service](#catalyst-content)
- [Lambda service](#catalyst-lambdas)
- [Comms service](#catalyst-achipelago)
- [Backend-for-frontend service](#catalyst-bff)

### Content Service {#catalyst-content}

The content service, provided by all [Catalysts](#catalyst), allows access to the distributed file-system. With this API, clients can query content indices, retrieve files, deploy entities and download periodic snapshots.

<div id="catalyst:lambdas"></div> <!-- stable ID for diagram -->

### Lambda Service {#catalyst-lambdas}

The lambda service, provided by all [Catalysts](#catalyst), offers a set of utility endpoints that allow clients to retrieve and validate commonly required data.

Some of the endpoints require access to blockchain state to verify the ownership of referenced assets. In these cases, [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/decentraland/collections-matic-mainnet) is used to query the blockchain.

<div id="catalyst:comms"></div> <!-- stable ID for diagram -->

### Comms Service {#catalyst-achipelago}

The _archipelago_ service, provided by all [Catalysts](#catalyst), groups players into dynamic clusters called _islands_, defined by proximity. It automatically balances the number of players on each island, and reassigns them as they travel the world to enable efficient peer-to-peer communications (such as text and voice chat).

The service is based on a generic transport layer that can be backed by different real-time systems in different areas, according to the configuration of each Catalyst.

- [Comms API reference](https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-api-specs/#tag/Comms)

### Backend for Frontend Service (BFF) {#catalyst-bff}

This service was created to resolve client needs to enable faster development of new features without breaking the existing APIs. In the Catalyst context, it's used for the communications between peers connected to the client, its main responsibility is to manage the P2P signaling.

## CLI {#cli}

The `dcl` [command-line interface](https://github.com/decentraland/cli) is the principal tool to assist content creators in the development of scenes and other projects.

Among other capabilities, it can bootstrap environments, run and visualize scenes, test them and deploy them to the [content network](#content).
