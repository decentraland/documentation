The `RestrictedActions` module allows scenes to access sensitive (and thus restricted) functionality. It's linked to the [`permission`]({{< ref "/contributor/content/entity-types/scenes#permissions" >}}) system, which scenes use to request the use of individual methods.

```ts
const RestrictedActions = require("~system/RestrictedActions")
```

{{< info >}}
As a World Explorer implementer, your runtime could have no enforcement of permissions. We **strongly** advise against this, since it puts players in danger.
{{< /info >}}

Most of the restricted functionality is provided by this module, but there's also restricted [global functions]({{< relref "../globals" >}}).

The module contains the following methods and types:

* [`function movePlayerTo`](#movePlayerTo)
* [`function teleportTo`](#teleportTo)
* [`function triggerEmote`](#triggerEmote)
* [`function changeRealm`](#changeRealm)
* [`function openExternalUrl`](#openExternalUrl)
* [`function openNftDialog`](#openNftDialog)
* [`function setCommunicationsAdapter`](#setCommunicationsAdapter)
* [`interface Vector3`](#Vector3)


## Methods

Each of the methods below is associated with a specific [permission]({{< ref "/contributor/content/entity-types/scenes#permissions" >}}) that can be requested in the scene manifest.

###### `movePlayerTo` {#movePlayerTo}

Displace the player to a new position relative to the current one, and optionally set the camera target with [vectors](#Vector3).

Requires the [`ALLOW_TO_MOVE_PLAYER_INSIDE_SCENE`]({{< ref "/contributor/content/entity-types/scenes#permissions" >}}) permission.

```ts
interface Request {
  newRelativePosition: Vector3
  cameraTarget?: Vector3
}

interface Response {}

function movePlayerTo(Request): Promise<Response>
```

###### `teleportTo` {#teleportTo}

Reposition the player to an absolute world location given a by [vectors](#Vector3).

Instead of requiring a pre-approved permission, each call to `teleportTo` must be approved by the player.

```ts
interface Request {
  worldPosition: Vector3
}

interface Response {}

function teleportTo(Request): Promise<Response>
```

###### `triggerEmote` {#triggerEmote}

Make the player's avatar display an emote animation, using one of the predefined names.

Requires the [`ALLOW_TO_TRIGGER_AVATAR_EMOTE`]({{< ref "/contributor/content/entity-types/scenes#permissions" >}}) permission.

```ts
interface Request {
  predefinedEmote: string
}

interface Response {}

function triggerEmote(Request): Promise<Response>
```

###### `openExternalUrl` {#openExternalUrl}

Offer to show a website to the player, using an appropriate UI (which may be another application).

Requires the [`OPEN_EXTERNAL_LINK`]({{< ref "/contributor/content/entity-types/scenes#permissions" >}}) permission.

```ts
interface Request {
  url: string
}

interface Response {
  // Whether the player authorized opening the link.
  success: boolean
}

function openExternalUrl(Request): Promise<Response>
```

###### `openNftDialog` {#openNftDialog}

Show information about an NFT to the player, using an appropriate UI.

```ts
interface Request {
  // The URN of the NFT.
  urn: string
}

interface Response {
  // Whether the NFT was successfully located and referred to an image or video.
  success: boolean
}

function openNftDialog(Request): Promise<Response>
```

###### `changeRealm` {#changeRealm}

Switch the World Explorer to another content server, using its base URL.

```ts
interface Request {
  // The URL of the new realm.
  realm: string

  // An optional message to show users when they have to approve the change.
  message?: string 
}

interface Response {
  // Whether the realm change was authorized and successful.
  success: boolean
}

function changeRealm(Request): Promise<Response>
```

## Types

The only additional type used by methods in this module is the `Vector3`.

###### `Vector3` {#Vector3}

Holds a relative or absolute 3d position.

```ts
interface Vector3 {
  x: number
  y: number
  z: number
}
```
