The World Explorer supports a list of basic components that share their definition with scenes, providing built-in support for positioning, animation, media, world state queries

There are five types of components:

1. [Object components](#object) add visual and physical properties to Entities.
2. [Game components](#game) can request actions and receive information from the game engine.
3. [Media components](#media) can display images and play sounds.
3. [Area components](#area) alter the behavior of Entities in specific zones.
4. [UI components](#ui) allow scenes to render floating interfaces.

Except for [`Transform`](#Transform), which is specified in detail below, the state of all components is serialized using protocol buffers. You can follow the link in each title to see the complete definition.


## Object Components {#object}

The most common components are those that attach visual and pyhisical properties to an Entity. They can be used to position, resize, paint and add collision to in-game objects.


---
###### `Transform` <small>[↗ spec](https://adr.decentraland.org/adr/ADR-153)</small> {#Transform}

Adds position, rotation and scale to an entity.

This component is, by a wide margin, the most commonly used and frequently updated during the lifespan of a scene. Because of this, `Transform` is not serialized using protocol buffers, and is instead packed into a custom structure.

`Transform` has a size of `44` bytes, with this exact layout:

```goat
.-----------------------.-------------------------------.-----------------------.-----------------.
|   x   |   y   |   z   |   x   |   y   |   z   |   w   |   x   |   y   |   z   | parent (uint32) |
'-----------------------'-------------------------------'-----------------------'-----------------'
╵  position (3x float)  ╵      rotation (4x float)      ╵   scale (3x float)    ╵          
```

This approach allows the runtime (especially in low-level code environments) to avoid intermediate serialization and deserialization steps. The memory where a `Transform` resides can be copied, shared and directly pointed to.

Coordinates can be fractionary, and thus use a 4-byte floating point number.

The `parent` field indicates that this Entity should be positioned relative to another one, identified by their ID. 

Since the null-value for `parent` is also the [`RootEntity`]({{< ref "/contributor/runtime/entities#RootEntity" >}}) ID (`0`), any `Transform` is relative to it by default.

By protocol, `Transform` must be serialized in big-endian byte order.

###### `MeshRenderer` <small>[↗ source](https://github.com/decentraland/protocol/blob/ccb88d679f20c0e22840c324879d7b2535f6c9a6/proto/decentraland/sdk/components/mesh_renderer.proto#L7)</small> {#MeshRenderer}

Provides basic rendering behavior for an Entity.

It can be set to render a plane, a sphere, a cube or cylinder. To render arbitrary 3D shapes, use [`GltfContainer`](#GltfContainer).


---
###### `MeshCollider` <small>[↗ source](https://github.com/decentraland/protocol/blob/ccb88d679f20c0e22840c324879d7b2535f6c9a6/proto/decentraland/sdk/components/mesh_collider.proto#L15)</small> {#MeshCollider}

Provides basic collision behavior and mouse pointer detection for an Entity.

It can be set to behave like a plane, a sphere, a cube or cylinder. To have a custom collision mesh, use [`GltfContainer`](#GltfContainer).


---
###### `Material` <small>[↗ source](https://github.com/decentraland/protocol/blob/ccb88d679f20c0e22840c324879d7b2535f6c9a6/proto/decentraland/sdk/components/material.proto#L19)</small> {#Material}

Sets the texture, lighting, color and transparency properties of an Entity that also has the [`MeshRenderer`](#MeshRenderer) component.

It's a complex structure designed to cover all common cases, but every field has a reasonable default value and can be left unspecified.

To completely customize the visual properties of an Entity, use [`GltfContainer`](#GltfContainer).


---
###### `GltfContainer` <small>[↗ source](https://github.com/decentraland/protocol/blob/ccb88d679f20c0e22840c324879d7b2535f6c9a6/proto/decentraland/sdk/components/gltf_container.proto#L7)</small> {#GltfContainer}

Attaches a 3D model to this Entity, given the [file path]({{< ref "/contributor/content/entities#files" >}}) of a `.gltf` asset in the scene's manifest.

Since the model has its own meshes and materials, this component overrides any behavior from [`MeshRenderer`](#MeshRenderer), [`MeshCollider`](#MeshCollider) and [`Material`](#Material).


---
###### `Billboard` <small>[↗ source](https://github.com/decentraland/protocol/blob/ccb88d679f20c0e22840c324879d7b2535f6c9a6/proto/decentraland/sdk/components/billboard.proto#L17)</small> {#Billboard}

Makes an Entity automatically reorient its `Transform` to face the camera. As the name indicates, it's used to display in-game billboards and frequently combined with [`TextShape`](#TextShape).

It affects all directions by default, but can be set to only rotate in one axis.


---
###### `Animator` <small>[↗ source](https://github.com/decentraland/protocol/blob/ccb88d679f20c0e22840c324879d7b2535f6c9a6/proto/decentraland/sdk/components/animator.proto#L7)</small> {#Animator}

Attached by the runtime to Entities that have a [`Raycast`](#Raycast) component pending results.

It contains information about the original ray and identifies any Entities that were hit.


## Media Components {#media}

Scenes can attach special components to display images, show video or play sounds. 

---
###### `AudioSource` <small>[↗ source](https://github.com/decentraland/protocol/blob/ccb88d679f20c0e22840c324879d7b2535f6c9a6/proto/decentraland/sdk/components/audio_source.proto#L7)</small> {#AudioSource}

Plays an audio clip bundled with the scene, given the [file's path in its manifest]({{< ref "/contributor/content/entities#files" >}}).

The sound originates from the associated entity's position. Its pitch, volume and looping behavior can be set, and the state of the audio player can be read.

{{< info >}}
In preparation for future upgrades, the field in `AudioSource` is called `audio_clip_url`, but in the current protocol version it's actually the manifest-defined path.
{{< /info >}}


---
###### `AudioStream` <small>[↗ source](https://github.com/decentraland/protocol/blob/ccb88d679f20c0e22840c324879d7b2535f6c9a6/proto/decentraland/sdk/components/audio_stream.proto#L7)</small> {#AudioStream}

It's defined with a 3D size vector and a desired camera mode.


## UI Components {#ui}

The following components are used to create graphical interfaces that hover on top of the game world.

They are usually attached to sets of Entities that have hierarchical [`UiTransform`](#UiTransform) components, related to one another via the `parent` attribute.

For example, a floating options window could be an Entity with a [`UiTransform`](#UiTransform) and a [`UiBackground`](#UiBackground) component, plus a Entity with a child [`UiTransform`](#UiTransform) and a [`UiDropdown`](#UiDropdown).
