When scenes require access to sensitive functionality, they must:

1. Declare the relevant [permissions in their manifest]({{< ref "/contributor/content/entity-types/scenes#permissions" >}}).

3. Use the [RestrictedActions]({{< relref "modules/restricted_actions" >}}) module to have the runtime perform the action (if authorized).

See those pages for more detailed information.
