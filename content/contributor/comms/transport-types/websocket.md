The websocket transport is one of the island messaging transports supported by the Decentraland comms protocol. Clients should use it when they receive an appropriate connection string from their realm's [Archipelago]({{< relref "../archipelago" >}}) service, or if it's indiciated as a fixed transport.

In the context of the websocket transport, an island is referred to as a _room_. Either name indicates the same thing: a group of nearby players that exchange updates and chat.

Connection strings begin with the `ws-room:` prefix, followed by a `wss://` URI for the specific room. They look like this:

```
ws-room:wss://comms.example.com/rooms/<room-id>
```

In the abscence of an explicit protocol for the websocket URI, `wss://` is assumed.


## Connecting

The transport uses the regular websocket protocol over HTTPS. Clients can open a connection using any standard implementation at their disposal.


## Websocket Packets

All messages from the websocket transport are serialized using the [`WsPacket`][WsPacket] structure. They implement a set of protocol-level connectivity and authentication messages, plus a container type for client messages.

{{< info >}}
The [`WsPacket`](#WsPacket) structure should not be confused with the message [`Packet`][Packet]. It's an additional wrapping layer specific to the websocket transport. Actual comms messages are contained in the [`WsPeerUpdate`](#WsPeerUpdate) type.
{{< /info >}}

| Field | Type | Value
| ----- | --- | --- |
| `message` | `enum` | One of `WsIdentification`, `WsChallengeRequired`, `WsSignedChallenge`, <br>`WsWelcome`, `WsPeerJoin`, `WsPeerLeave`, `WsKicked` or `WsPeerUpdate`.


## Authentication

Before they can start relaying messages to others, clients must authenticate by signing a challenge string. This is required even when the transport URI was obtained from [Archipelago]({{< relref "../archipelago" >}}) after a previous round of authentication.

The first message a client sends when joining an island is [`WsIdentification`][WsIdentification], which contains a public address. It will be responded with [`WsChallengeRequired`](#WsChallengeRequired), and clients send a [`WsSignedChallenge`](#WsSignedChallenge) in reply.

  |  Server  |                | Client |

       o - - - - - - - - - - - - -|
       |                          |
       |                          |
       |         WsIdentification |
       |<-------------------------+
       +------------------------->|
       | WsChallengeRequired      |
       |                          |
       |                          |
       |        WsSignedChallenge |
       |<-------------------------+
       +------------------------->|
       | WsWelcome                |
       |                          |
```


If the flow is completed successfully, the client will receive a [`WsWelcome`](#WsWelcome) and can start sending messages to peers.

| `already_connected` | `string` | A server hint to clients, indicating that prior connections may be closed.

| `alias` | `uint32` | A server-generated ID for the client's session
| `peer_identities` | `map<uint32, string>` | The addresses of all current peers, indexed by alias


## Connectivity

Three messages are defined to help clients keep track of their peers and their own status.

[`WsPeerJoin`](#WsPeerJoin) is received when a fellow client connects to the room and successfully authenticates, while [`WsPeerLeave`](#WsPeerLeave) is received when peers disconnect.

There's also the [`WsKicked`](#WsKicked) message, which informs clients that their connection is about to be closed and the reason for it. In current practice, the main reason a server can kick a client from a room is because they've simultaneously connected to another room, when that is forbidden by server policy.

###### `WsPeerJoin` <small>[↗ source][WsPeerJoin]</small> {#WsPeerJoin}

| Field | Type | Value
| ----- | --- | --- |
| `alias` | `uint32` | The server-generated ID sent in [`WsWelcome`](#WsWelcome)
| `address` | `string` | The new peer's Ethereum address


---
###### `WsPeerLeave` <small>[↗ source][WsPeerLeave]</small> {#WsPeerLeave}

| Field | Type | Value
| ----- | --- | --- |
| `alias` | `uint32` | The server-generated ID of the disconnected peer

| Field | Type | Value
| ----- | --- | --- |
| `reason` | `string` | The server's explanation of why the connection will be closed


## Client Messages

To send comms [messages]({{< relref "../messages" >}}), clients wrap them in the [`WsPeerUpdate`](#WsPeerUpdate) structure. This differentiates the transport control message types from the actual messages sent between peers.

.-------------------.                                                                               
| WsPacket          |
|  .--------------. |
|  | WsPeerUpdate | |
|  | .----------. | |
|  | |  Packet  | | |
|  | '----------' | |
|  '--------------' |
'-------------------'
```

---
###### `WsPeerUpdate` <small>[↗ source][WsPeerUpdate]</small> {#WsPeerUpdate}

| Field | Type | Value
| ----- | --- | --- |
| `from_alias` | `uint32` | The sender's server-generated ID
| `body` | `bytes` | The serialized [message]({{< relref "../messages" >}}) being wrapped
| `unreliable` | `bool` | Whether the sender prioritized speed or reliability for deliverying this message

Clients must set the `from_alias` field to `0` when sending, and the server will fill it with the correct identifier before delivering it to peers.
