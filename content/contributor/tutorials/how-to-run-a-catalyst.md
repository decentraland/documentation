Ever felt curious about how Decentraland Catalyst nodes work? Ever wanted to run your own node and felt overwhelmed about where to start? Are you building content for Decentraland and finding it hard to do the whole development and testing cycles on production servers?

If you are (or have been there), fear no more. This tutorial will help you in the process of planning, figuring out what you need to decide and then guide you step by step in starting up the server. Also, in case something might not go according to the plan, there is a troubleshooting section at the end with a few of the most common problems and how to fix them.

Ready? Hands on to the task.

## Hardware requirements

The Decentraland Foundation servers are deployed on Amazon AWS on `t2.xlarge` instances. So while those servers are meant for public use, your own one may be ok with much smaller specs, depending on what the intended use will be.

An AWS EC2 `t2.xlarge` has the following hardware:

- 4 vCPUs.
- 16 Gb RAM

And for file storage + DB storage, an SSD / HDD with 2 Tb capacity should be more than sufficient. At the time of this writing the foundation servers are using a little over 1 Tb for all storage.

## Software pre-requisites

The following are required for running catalyst-owner:

- Linux / MacOS operating system
- Docker / docker-compose
- Git
- LiveKit Cluster 

## Some options to consider before we start

- Do you want your node to be publicly exposed on the Internet? If so, you will need an internet-exposed instance and a public URL to connect to it.
- Is the node going to be used for the development of scenes, wearables, etc? In this case, the hardware specs can be a lot smaller, as it will probably be one or two people accessing it, not hundreds of users.
- Do you want to sync all entity types? If you are using this for developing scenes, probably you want to skip synchronization of profiles, as they take a lot of time, bandwidth and most importantly disk space and wonâ€™t benefit you for your goal.

## LiveKit

An external LiveKit cluster is in needed by the Catalyst's Comms service to orchestrate the communications between players. For that, there are two options: use a LiveKit Cloud account or run your own LiveKit cluster.

The recommendation is to setup [Livekit Cloud account](https://cloud.livekit.io/) which comes with a free tier that can manage 100 users, or paying the service according to the traffic. This approach is easier as it doesnâ€™t require to provision extra infrastructure and the service can manage the scaling.
Otherwise a LiveKit cluster will need to be provisioned. LiveKit does a very good job with their documentation:
- [Deployment](https://docs.livekit.io/oss/deployment/)
- [Distributed Setup](https://docs.livekit.io/oss/deployment/distributed/)

*In case you would like to deep dive on the technical details needed to support LiveKit transport based communications, check out the [ADR-70 New Communications Architecture](https://adr.decentraland.org/adr/ADR-70).*

## Step by step guide

First thing to do is clone the [catalyst-owner](https://github.com/decentraland/catalyst-owner) repository from GitHub

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/decentraland/catalyst-owner.git
Cloning into 'catalyst-owner'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 2392, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (602/602), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (168/168), done.
remote: Total 2392 (delta 506), reused 481 (delta 430), pack-reused 1790
Receiving objects: 100% (2392/2392), 926.05 KiB | 1.09 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (1257/1257), done.
> cd catalyst-owner
```

Once thatâ€™s done, itâ€™s time to configure the environment variables for the node, and make any changes as appropriate.

```bash
# On the /catalyst-owner folder
> cp .env.example .env
> cp .env-advanced.example .env-advanced
```

Now using your favorite text editor, make any needed changes in these files. For e.g., setting up the `EMAIL` environment variable with valid email is required so that you can receive updates about Certbot certificate expiration.

Also setting up your particular value for `CATALYST_URL` may be required, especially if your server is going to be exposed publicly on the Internet. For use in your local machine, the default of `http://localhost` will do.

#### Comms Service

Once the LiveKit cluster is available you will need to set the specific LiveKit variables for the Comms service to work, e.g.:

```
LIVEKIT_HOST=wss://livekit-1.mydomain.org
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=API-JjHuvM
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=J7YSHmNzkNCEfT2
ROOM_PREFIX=my-prefix
```

The `ROOM_PREFIX` variable is optional and can be configured to identify LiveKit rooms created by the Catalyst. This is useful if more than one Catalyst is using the same LiveKit Cluster.

#### Content Server 

There is a variable called `CONTENT_SERVER_STORAGE` that defines the local folder that the content server will use for storage. This defaults to `CONTENT_SERVER_STORAGE=./storage`. You may change this value to store files somewhere else, or at least make sure that the referenced folder exists. You may need to create it like this:

```bash
# On the /catalyst-owner folder or wherever CONTENT_SERVER_STORAGE is pointing to
> mkdir storage
```

There is another interesting variable `SYNC_IGNORED_ENTITY_TYPES` which allows ignoring certain entity types during the synchronization process. If you are going to use the Catalyst server for development, perhaps you don't need all content type to be synchronized. You can set env var `SYNC_IGNORED_ENTITY_TYPES="profile,store"` so that only scenes and wearables will be brought from the DAO servers. This will save a lot of time, bandwidth and disk storage in your server.

>ðŸ’¡ For a more exhaustive list of supported environment variables please have a look at the [Environment variables](#environment-variables) section below.

### Launch the Catalyst node 

Once all environment variables have been set up, it is time to start the node. That should be as easy as running the `init.sh` script in the root folder.

```bash
# On the /catalyst-owner folder

> ./init.sh
## Loading env variables... [ OK ]

## Catalyst server is up and running at http://localhost
```

If all went well, we now have a full Decentraland node running. You can now head to the browser and type the URL. If using the default, it should be [`http://localhost`](http://localhost/).

We can check the content server logs with this docker command:

```bash
> docker logs catalyst-owner_content-server_1
```

Even though the server is now running, itâ€™s not 100% ready to be in business. It needs to synchronize the content from the other [servers of the DAO](https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-monitor) so it can offer the same experience to users connected to it. Synchronization can take a long time. On a good internet connection, 6 hours should be pretty common. Soâ€¦ time to have a coffee, a nap, a good night's rest, and come back tomorrow.

One way of knowing whether synchronization is complete consists of checking the results of the content status endpoint: [http://localhost/content/status](http://localhost/content/status) (use your URL here).
```json
{
  "synchronizationStatus": {
    "lastSyncWithDAO": 1658153514917,
    "synchronizationState": "Bootstrapping"
  },
  "snapshot": {
    "entities": {
      "profile": 1271331,
      "scene": 23477,
      "wearable": 17351,
      "store": 890
    },
    "lastUpdatedTime": 1658153414530
  },
  "version": "v3",
  "commitHash": "9a2e0d5d05d02646df2e1e5d00436d3166a07aa1",
  "catalystVersion": "4.8.6",
  "ethNetwork": "mainnet"
}
```

While `synchronizationState` is `Bootstrapping`, the node will temporarily suspend the acceptance of new deployments. This measure ensures that no new entities are deployed until the node is brought up-to-date within the DAO network. Once the status changes to `Syncing`, it indicates that the node has successfully caught up and is now continuously receiving the latest updates. This is the healthy state in which the node is fully working and accepting new deployments.

```json
{
  "synchronizationStatus": {
    "lastSyncWithDAO": 1658153872301,
    "synchronizationState": "Syncing"
  },
  "snapshot": {
    "entities": {
      "profile": 1271317,
      "scene": 23477,
      "store": 890,
      "wearable": 17350
    },
    "lastUpdatedTime": 1658152050030
  },
  "version": "v3",
  "commitHash": "9a2e0d5d05d02646df2e1e5d00436d3166a07aa1",
  "catalystVersion": "4.8.6",
  "ethNetwork": "mainnet"
}
```

If you are more of cli-kind-of-guy, you can grep the content server docker image logs for this message: `Starting to sync entities from servers pointer changes`. Once you see that text, the content server is fully synchronized and ready for full use.

## Using your node for production

If you want to run your own server and help scale the network, first of all thatâ€™s awesome, the community and the foundation really appreciate you doing so.

In this case, youâ€™ll have to go through the process of requesting the DAO for approval to join the network by visiting [this link](https://governance.decentraland.org/submit/catalyst/). You may also ask for a MANA grant in order to cover the infrastructure and management expenses.

It is important that your hardware specs are more inline with what is suggested above in the hardware requirements, as the server will be used by any members of the community to enter Decentraland.

## API Specs

For more details on the APIs for content, lambdas and comms servers you can check the [API specs](https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-api-specs).

## Troubleshooting/FAQ

A few things could go wrong while starting your server. Here is a few of the most common issues encountered over time and how to fix them.

### Port 5432 is used by local postgres

If you run the node on a machine used for development, or if it is already hosting other services, chances are thereâ€™s already a postgres database server running on that machine. So port 5432 will be already taken.

The easiest way to fix this is to stop the postgres that is already running locally and then restart the postgres docker container using `docker start postgres`.

If you have knowledge on docker compose, you can start fiddling with `docker-compose.yml` and environment variables to try to get it to work on a different port. For the sake of keeping things simple here, we will avoid going that path in this tutorial.

### Port 80 port is used by local nginx

Same thing can happen with port 80 (and even port 443). If you are running nginx in the local machine, chances are that ports 80/443 are already bound that that service, so the Catalyst Docker container wonâ€™t be able to use them.

Again, the simplest approach would be to stop the local nginx service and then restart the docker container using `docker start nginx`. Or alternatively, you need to leverage `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` to get it to work on a different port.
