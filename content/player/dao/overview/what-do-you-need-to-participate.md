Broadly speaking, DAOs are organizations comprising token holders. In Decentraland’s case, the tokens needed to be a member of the DAO are MANA, NAMES or LAND. By holding either MANA, NAMES or LAND, you may create and vote in proposals. Your vote on a proposal is weighted according to the balance of MANA, NAMES and LAND you have at the time that proposal was created. For more information, see the Voting Power section in the [DAO User Guide]({{< ref "/content/player/dao/dao-userguide.md" >}}).

Anyone is allowed and welcome to participate in discussions related to the DAO in [Discord](https://dcl.gg/daodiscord), the [Forum](https://forum.decentraland.org/), or any of Decentraland’s other social channels, but only token holders can cast votes and create proposals.
