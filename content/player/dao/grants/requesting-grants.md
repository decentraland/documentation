To [request a grant]({{< ref "/content/player/dao/grants/community-grants.md" >}}) from the Decentraland DAO, begin by navigating to **[governance.decentraland.org](https://governance.decentraland.org)** and signing in with your wallet.


Click **Submit a proposal** and choose **Grant request** from the list of proposal categories. You will be presented with a form that you must complete before submitting your request.

## Grant proposal form

Decentraland Grants allow MANA owned by the DAO to fund the creation of features or content beneficial to the Decentraland platform and its growth. Either individuals or teams may request grant funding through the DAO, and there are no constraints on the content or features that may be funded (within the bounds of Decentraland’s [ Content Policy](https://decentraland.org/content)).
Following is an overview of the proposal form:

## Category
Select the category that best suits your project. Currently, DAO grants will fund projects within seven categories:
* **Core Unit:** Provide core infrastructure and operations for the DAO
* **Platform:** Creation of tools and applications extending our platform and ecosystem
* **Documentation:** Production of free educational content related to Decentraland’s dynamics
* **In-world Content:** Development of experiences aiming to improve user retention
* **Social Media Content:** Marketing efforts aiming to reach new users and keeping them engaged
* **Sponsorship:** Supporting In-Real-Life initiatives targeting audiences relevant to Decentraland
* **Accelerator:** A private company of for-profit initiative in need of funding


## Funding
Every grant category has its own category budget, which is renewed every three months. You will see the remaining category budget based on the category that you had previously selected. 

**Desired Funding**  
Enter the exact amount of funding you are requesting for your grant in USD. This amount should be within range for the Tier you’ve selected. If your grant is approved, it will be paid in MANA according to the current exchange rate between USD and MANA.

**Estimated project duration**  
Enter the amount of months your project will take to be developed. It will be used to create the vesting contract issuing monthly payments. Make sure to provide a detaild roadmap for the project duration below.

**Time of payments**  
Enter the time of the month you’d like the funds to be released. This could either be: 
* 1st day of the month
* 15th day of the month

## General Information

**Title**  
Provide a title that is concise and descriptive for your grant request. This title will appear as the header of your proposal’s detail page on [ governance.decentraland.org](https://governance.decentraland.org/) , the proposal in Snapshot, and the Forum thread generated for your proposal.

**Abstract**  
Please explain the key components of your project. This should include a description of the feature or content you want to create, what needs or goals your work may satisfy, and the skills or experience you have that will contribute to your success. This is your chance to make a good first impression on the community.

**Description**  
Elaborate on why your project should receive funding, the problems that your project will solve, or the benefits it will bring to the Decentraland platform.

**Budget Specification**  
The community values budget transparency. Please provide a detailed description on how you are planning to use your budget.

**Beneficiary Address**  
The address that will receive the grant funds. This must be an Ethereum address! Entering a non-Ethereum address that cannot receive MANA may result in a permanent loss of funds.

**Contact Email Address**  
This email address will be used by the Grant Support teams to contact you to check the progress of the grant, set up meetings and maintain an open communication channel.

**Personnel**  
Please list who will be working on this project, along with an explicit overview of their relevant skill sets and experience. You may provide links to portfolios or profiles to help the Decentraland community get to know who the DAO will be funding and how their backgrounds will contribute to your project’s success.

**Roadmap and milestones**  
Describe the roadmap of your project, making sure to include any relevant milestones that the community should be aware of and how you will share progress you have made. Clearly communicating progress for long-term projects funded by vesting contracts will help prevent the removal of your funding.

**Co-authors** (optional)  
If you co-authored this proposal with someone else, you can add their wallet addresses to acknowledge their work. After you publish the proposal, co-authors will be asked to confirm or reject the request. Only if they confirm, they will be listed publicly on the proposal page.
