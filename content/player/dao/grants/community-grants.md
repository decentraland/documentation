The Decentraland DAO possesses a [MANA fund]({{< ref "/content/player/dao/overview/the-dao-fund.md" >}})  that has been set aside to help sponsor and facilitate the continual growth of the Decentraland platform. One avenue used by the DAO to achieve these goals is a grants program that was voted in place by the community.

This grants program allows any member of the community to request funding to make contributions in community building and education, creating 3D content for the world, or implementing new features and improvements to the platform.

Grants can be requested by completing a proposal form within the [DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/). If approved by the community, then the [DAO Committee]({{< ref "/content/player/dao/overview/how-does-the-dao-work.md#dao-committee" >}}) will execute the transfer of funds to the grant beneficiary by means of a one-time transfer, or a vesting contract.

## Grant tiers

Grants may be requested for any amount within one of two possible tiers, regardless of the grant category. For example, you may request a Content Creator grant in either of both tiers.
The specific tiers, and their ranges, are:

**Lower Tier:**  
* Up to $20,000 USD, payable in stablecoins or MANA using a Vesting Contract, or a one-time payment (after 30 days).
* Vesting duration can range from 1 to 6 months.
* Votation period: 2 weeks.
* Votation threshold: 2M VP.

**Higher Tier:**  
* From $20,000 to $240,000 USD, payable in stablecoins using a Vesting Contract.
* Vesting duration can range from 3 to 12 months.
* Votation Period: 2 weeks.
* Variable votation threshold, using the formula: [1.2M + TOTAL_BUDGET * 40VP/USD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VAVGZYbhV98hHxc2M39d-6XqeVG8ov2kvS9Yaxp0TyY/edit#gid=1241323121).
	* E.g. $60,000 USD requires 3,600,000 VP
	* E.g. $120,000 USD requires 6,000,000 VP
	* E.g. $240,000 USD requires 10,800,000 VP

## When are payments made for each tier? 
Funds for grants are made available to the beneficiary address via vesting contracts. The grantee selects the starting date when requesting the grant, which can be either the 1st or 15th of each month following the day of the grant's approval. These contracts vest every 30 days from the starting date. After this period, the owner of the beneficiary address may withdraw the vested funds on a monthly basis.


## Grant Budgeting System

The DAO has an income of 1.8M MANA every month and it has set up a limit control to not spend more than 70% of such a stream. This mitigates the risk of running out of funds, securing the long-standing operations of the DAO. The Decentraland Grants Program is divided into four periods (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4), effective since January 1st, 2023. At the beginning of each quarter the maximum amount of money that can be allocated through the Grants Program is defined using the formula: 5,500,000 * MANA_PRICE * 0.7. This means the DAO at maximum capacity will be spending 70% of the MANA received from the vesting contract.

The DAO agreed on a [governance proposal](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=e0fd0b17-a304-4c57-8897-4a830280d74c) on limits for each category of grants. The DAO refreshes and recalculates the category budgets using the MANA price at the beginning of each quarter. When a category reaches its budget, No more grant requests will be accepted for that category.

 The [allocation per category](https://github.com/Decentraland-DAO/transparency/blob/main/src/budgets.json) is the following starting on Q2 2024 (April):

* Platform 50% 
* In-World Building 15% 
* Core Unit 15% 
* Community Experiences 10% 
* Sponsorship 2% 
* Accelerator 2% 
* Social Media Content 4% 
* Documentation 2%
