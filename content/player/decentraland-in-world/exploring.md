Decentraland is completely made up of community-generated content. When you’re out exploring, you never know what you might discover—whether it’s on the Genesis City map or in someone’s World! The options can feel overwhelming, so here are a few tips for getting the most out of your adventure.

## Exploring Genesis City

With thousands of community-owned parcels to cross in Genesis City, just walking straight across is its own adventure. However, if you’d like to be more precise in your exploration, you’ll find the Map to be very helpful.

### **Use the Map to Discover**

The Map can be opened by clicking on the Mini Map in the top left corner of your screen or by clicking on the Map icon in the sidebar menu.

### **Layers & Pins**

Looking at the satellite image of Genesis City, you’ll notice a lot of different icons. **To change the map type and toggle location pins**, click on the layers icon in the lower left of the map.

The red ‘**Live Events**’ pins show the location of an event that is currently happening. Click on the icon to see more about the event and click ‘Jump In’ to teleport to its location.

The yellow ‘**Points of Interest**’ pins mark locations the community deemed to be must-see—they could be anything from a game to an impressive work of art. Clicking on the icon will bring up a description and a ‘Jump In’ button to teleport you directly.

### **Location Categories**

Discoverer interesting locations in Decentraland based on categories. When you open the map, you’ll see a variety of Category bubbles along the top of the screen, including topics like Art, Music, Games, etc. 

Click on a category to bring up pins marking the locations tagged with that category. Clicking on one will open an information card with a description as well as a ‘Jump In’ button so you can teleport directly to the scene.

### **Teleport to Specific Parcels**

In-world, you can jump directly to a specific parcel using the **Map** or **Chat Commands**.

- **Teleportation via Map:** Clicking any location on the Map will bring up an info card on the location, even if it’s an empty parcel. This card will also have a ‘Jump In’ button that will teleport you to the spot.
- **Teleportation via Chat Command:** If you know the coordinates of the parcel you want to jump to, put the following command into the Nearby chat box (in the bottom left of your screen) and hit [**Enter**].
    - `/goto x,y` (e.g. `/goto 0,0` for Genesis Plaza)

## Exploring Worlds

In contrast to Genesis City, **Worlds** are more intimate virtual spaces, like personal islands located off the Decentraland map. They can only be visited via teleportation.

### Discover New Worlds

While Worlds tend to be more private, you can discover them by browsing Worlds listed on the [**Places page**](https://decentraland.org/places/worlds/) and by attending events hosted at Worlds.

Over 1K World owners choose to publicly list their Worlds on the Places page, making them easier to discover. Browse through them and filter by categories to find the perfect World for your daily adventure.

Events can also be hosted in Worlds—attending them you can make friends and explore! Below is an example of an event hosted in a World. By the ruby ‘jump in’ arrow, you can see the World’s name in place of Genesis City coordinates.

### Teleport to a World

If you know the name of a World, you can teleport to it using a **Chat Command**. Just put the following command into the Nearby chat box (in the bottom left  of your screen) and hit [**Enter**].

- `/goto World’sName`  (e.g. `/goto officehours`)
