The best way to meet new people in Decentraland is to attend events! Anyone in the community can submit an event to Decentraland’s Event page, so you can discover a wide variety of events, from annual music festivals to weekly hang outs, if you stay updated.

**How check current and upcoming events in Decentraland:**

- **Event Page:** Browse Decentraland’s Event page at [decentraland.org/events](http://decentraland.org/events). You can jump directly to live events or RSVP to upcoming events to get an in-world notification when they start.
- **Genesis Plaza:** Check the Event board when you land in Genesis Plaza. It will display events happening soon.
- **World Map:** To see where live events are happening, open the map in-world and look for a red and white icon. Clicking on it will bring up event info and a jump in button.
- Follow Decentraland [**socials**](https://twitter.com/decentraland) or [**subscribe**](https://decentraland.beehiiv.com/subscribe) to the weekly newsletter to stay updated
