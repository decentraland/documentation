In Decentraland—with community-made Wearables and Emotes—you can shape your avatar to be *anyone,* whether it’s the truest version of yourself or your hidden alter ego.

## Avatar Appearance

Edit your avatar’s appearance in the Backpack. Look for a backpack icon in the sidebar menu. Here you can change your avatar’s body features and attire.

**Getting More Wearables**

In addition to the free, starter items that are always available in your Backpack, you can choose from thousands of community-made Wearables in Decentraland’s Marketplace at [decentraland.org/marketplace](http://decentraland.org/marketplace). Featuring everything from clothing, hair styles, full skins, and more, you’re sure to find what you need to create your unique look. Purchased items will appear in your Backpack in-world.

## Emoting with Your Avatar

Emotes are animations that allow your avatar to express reactions, perform dance moves, or engage in activities such as yoga or painting. You can trigger them from the Emote Wheel when you press ‘**B**’ or click on the dancing figure icon in the sidebar menu.

**Customizing Your Emote Wheel**

The Emote Wheel has 10 slots for different Emotes. You can customize which Emotes appear there from your Backpack.

**Getting More Emotes**

Like the starter Wearables in your Backpack, your avatar will always have the free, basic  Emotes available to everyone, but there’s even more community-made Emotes waiting to be discovered in Decentraland’s Marketplace at [decentraland.org/marketplace](http://decentraland.org/marketplace). Any Emotes you purchase will appear in your Backpack in-world.
