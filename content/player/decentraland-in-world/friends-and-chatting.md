# Friends & Chatting

Decentraland is all about bringing people from around the world together. Making friends and chatting is key to feeling a part of the virtual world’s community. Here you’ll learn how to manage your friendships and chats.

## Friendship Management

The Friends icon lives in the bottom left of your screen and is home to your Friends List, Friend Requests, and Blocked accounts.

### **Friend’s List**

Hovering by a Friend’s name will make other options appear. If you’re friend is online, you can chat or jump to their location. If you click on the three dots by their name, you can access their personal menu.

### **Friend Requests**

To send a friend request to someone, open their profile (hovering over any avatar with your mouse will show the option to ‘View Profile’). In the top right corner of the profile card, you’ll see a ruby ‘Add Friend’ button. After selecting that, you’ll have the option to add a message to your friend request before sending it out.

See requests you’ve sent and received in the ‘Requests’ tab of your Friends interface. Requests with an envelop icon have a message attached. Read it by clicking on the envelope.

To cancel a request or unfriend someone, you’ll use the same button in their profile, as it changes in relation to your status with someone. Hovering over the button will show the option to cancel requests or unfriend.

## Blocking Accounts

If you block a player in Decentraland, you will no longer see their avatar in-world, and they will not be able to send you friend requests or messages. You will also not see each other’s messages in public or private chats.

**How to Block a Player**

To block a player, open their profile card by clicking on their avatar and click on the three dots in the upper right corner above their avatar image, then select the option ‘Block’. You can also block someone within a chat by clicking on their name to open their personal menu and selecting ‘Block’.

**How to Unblock a Player**

Blocked accounts appear in a sperate tab of your ‘Friends’ interface. Hovering over someone’s name in this section will reveal the ‘Unblock’ button.

## Chats

In Decentraland, the main line of communication is text-based chatting. In-world, you can always see a chat bar in the lower left of your screen. This is where you can send DMs to friends (or anyone depending on selected settings) and chat with the people around you via the Nearby Chat.

### Nearby Chat

Identifiable by the Decentraland icon, Nearby Chat is where you can chat with the people around you in-world, even if you aren’t friends. It will always be listed at the top of your chat list. Nearby Chat can also be used for entering Chat commands that only you will see—learn more [**here**]({{< ref "/content/player/FAQs/decentraland-101.md#what-are-useful-chat-commands-in-decentraland" >}}).

### Private Chats

The option to start chatting with someone can be accessed from their Profile or personal menu. If you are friends with them, a chat icon will also appear next to their name in your Friends List. However, keep in mind, outside of friendships, who you can send and receive DMs from will depend on both parties’ chat settings.

Please also note that messages can only be sent to players that are currently online.

### Chat Settings

Within your in-world Settings, you’ll see a Chat tab.

**DM Permissions**

There are two options when it comes to selecting who you want to be able to send and receive DMs from:

- **Friends Only:** You’ll only be able to send and receive private messages from Friends
- **Everyone:** Players who select this option will be able to send private messages to each other, even if they are not friends.

**Notification Pings**

If you have your sound on, you have the option of receiving a notification ping for selected chats. You can set your preferences from each individual chat by clicking on the 3 dots in the upper right of a chat box. From the main Chat Settings, you can select the setting for all your chats simultaneously.

**Chat Bubbles**

You may notice chat bubbles appearing over avatars when you’re in-world. Currently, you can choose to see chat bubbles for no chats, all chats, or only the Nearby Chat. Chat bubbles from private chats can only be seen by the chat’s participants.
