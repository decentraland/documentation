**‘In-World**’ refers to anything happening inside Decentraland’s virtual world—this is where the magic happens!

Decentraland’s main landmass, Genesis City.

## **How to Jump Into Decentraland**

To enter the virtual world, you must first download [Decentraland’s desktop app](https://decentraland.org/download/). Once you’ve installed it and logged into your Decentraland account, you can start exploring Decentraland’s Genesis City (pictured above), and it’s archipelago of off-map Worlds. 

## Genesis City vs. Worlds: Decentraland’s Landscape Explained

**Genesis City** is the main landmass of Decentraland, visible on the virtual world’s map. It’s made up of thousands of community-owned LAND parcels, each 16m x 16m in size, and traded in [Decentraland’s Marketplace](https://decentraland.org/marketplace/lands). As the city is laid out in a massive, four-quadrant grid, each parcel is referenced by a set of coordinates—at the very center (0,0), lies Decentraland’s default spawn point: Genesis Plaza.

Despite being a patchwork of individually-owned parcels, Genesis City is unique in its openness and traversability. If you’re looking for an adventure, just take a walk across the map—there’s always something new to discover from Decentraland’s global community!

In contrast to Genesis City LAND parcels, **Worlds** are more intimate virtual spaces, like personal islands located off the Decentraland map. While you can’t walk to them, you can teleport to a World if you know its name or have an invite link. Unlock your own World by [getting a Decentraland NAME](https://decentraland.org/marketplace/names/claim). It’s your space to use as you wish—set it as private or public, host events, or practice your building skills.
