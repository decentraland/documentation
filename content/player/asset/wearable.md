Wearables in Decentraland are the main cosmetics for avatars. These cosmetics allow the complete change of appearance from head to toe. They consist of two types: basic Wearables, which are non-NFT items available to all Decentraland users, and collectible, tradeable NFT Wearables.

### Basic Wearable

Basic Wearables are free to use for every user and are available upon loading into Decentraland. These assets are currently limited to a certain amount for each category.

### NFT Wearable

Early Wearable collections were minted on the Ethereum Blockchain. Due to increasing GAS fees, however, newer collections are only minted on Layer 2, Polygon Blockchain, since 2021. At this point in time, its not possible to mint new Decentraland Wearable collections on Ethereum. 

**Wearable Rarities**
NFT Wearables have varying rarities, with some being more unique and scarce than others due to differences in their supply categories. Below are the available categories and their supply cap.

Unique:	1
Mythic:	10
Exotic:	50
Legendary: 100
Epic: 1000
Rare: 5000
Uncommon: 10000
Common: 100000

### Smart Wearable

Smart Wearables are digital accessories and clothing items that offer interactive and enhanced functionalities beyond mere visual appearance. These Wearables can provide various features and benefits to the avatars wearing them, enhancing the user experience within the virtual world. They add a layer of functionality and personalization to avatars, making them more than just decorative items in Decentraland.

By incorporating code, smart Wearables can become highly customizable and dynamic, offering users additional functions and capabilities beyond those of conventional Wearables. More information can be found here: https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/sdk7/smart-wearables/
