Emotes in Decentraland are animated actions and gestures used by avatars. They serve as a form of expression, enabling users to communicate and interact more dynamically.

NFT emotes debuted during Metaverse Fashion Week 2022, advancing digital expression in Decentraland. Before this event, emotes were available but not as NFTs, restricting their customization and tradeability. In September 2022, all users were given access to create, market, and sell their own Emotes.

About a year later, Emotes 2.0 introduced the ability to add sounds and props, making emotes more dynamic and interactive. This upgrade enriched user experiences, adding immersive audio and visual elements.

### How Can I Buy Emotes?
