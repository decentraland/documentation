NFTs, or so-called Non-Fungible Tokens, represent ownership of digital assets and can include art, music, collectibles and other digital goods. These assets are stored on the blockchain, ensuring their rarity and security.

Decentraland NFTs, specifically, are used within the platform to represent virtual LAND, Wearables as cosmetics, and NAMEs or Emotes for avatar customization, allowing users to interact within this virtual environment.

Users can buy, sell, and trade NFTs on Decentraland’s Marketplace with MANA. Additionally, creators can design and mint their own NFTs, adding to the diversity and richness of the virtual world.

### MANA

MANA is the native cryptocurrency or digital token that serves as the primary medium of exchange and utility within Decentraland's ecosystem.

### LAND

LAND in Decentraland represents parcels of virtual land that users can buy, own, develop, and trade on the Marketplace. These parcels form the foundation of Decentraland, where users can build businesses, attractions and other 3d experiences.

### NAME

Name NFTs allow users to claim unique names for their avatars, providing a personalized identity within Decentraland. These names are one-of-a-kind and can be bought, sold, and traded on the Marketplace.

### Wearable

Wearable NFTs are virtual clothing and accessories that avatars can wear, offering a way to customize and express individuality. These items range from common to unique and can be traded or sold in Decentraland’s Marketplace.

### Emote

Emote NFTs enable avatars to perform unique actions and gestures, enhancing interaction and expression in Decentraland. These emotes can be created by users, traded on the Marketplace, and sometimes come with additional features like sounds and props.
