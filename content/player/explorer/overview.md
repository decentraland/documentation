The explorer allows users to visit and explore Decentraland, interact with their avatars, view rendered and deployed content, and navigate through Genesis City or Worlds. It is accessible through the browser version, compatible with most internet browsers, and the desktop client, available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

In addition to the existing desktop client, the Decentraland Foundation is focusing on developing a new Client (currently named DCL 2.0) in 2024 to enhance performance and stability. This new client aims to lay the foundation for future mobile and VR clients. A preview of ist upcoming features has been shared during the first Decentraland Community Summit 2024, which was held in Argentina, South America.

Furthermore, a team funded by the Decentraland DAO is currently working on two other explorer instances, one of which supports mobile devices. While these projects are in early stages, they demonstrate potential and are open-source initiatives, welcoming contributions from anyone interested in their development.
