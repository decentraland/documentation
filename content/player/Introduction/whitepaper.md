## White Paper 2.0 (2024)

With 7 years passed since the original white paper's publishing, a new white paper was published in 2024 as part of the 'Decentraland 2.0' movement, which involved the release of an entirely new desktop client for Decentraland, integrating the learnings gathered since the platform's original launch in 2020. Serving as a guide for both veterans and newcomers, this document expands on the need for decentralized technology and reaffirms Decentraland's mission, documents its history, evolution, and impact since release, details its technological architecture, and lays out the roadmap planned for its continued development.

## Original White Paper (2017)

Decentraland's original white paper was published in 2017, 3 years before the platform would launch to the public. It was written by Decentraland founders Esteban Ordano, Ariel Meilich, Yemel Jardi, and Manuel Araoz. This white paper presents a detailed explanation of the original philosophical motivations behind the Decentraland project, along with a rigorous discussion of the proposed technical and economic approaches to building Decentraland.
