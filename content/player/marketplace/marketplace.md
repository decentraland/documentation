The Marketplace is the go-to place to trade and manage all your Decentraland assets like Wearables, Emotes, LAND, and more.

Access the Marketplace at [https://decentraland.org/marketplace/](https://https://decentraland.org/marketplace/).

The Marketplace allows you to:

- **Sell** parcels and Estates of LAND, Wearables, Emotes and unique NAMEs. Set your own price in MANA and an expiration date for the listing.
- **Buy** parcels and Estates, Wearables, Emotes, and unique NAMEs for sale.
- **Transfer** your Decentraland assets to another user.


## Logging In

You can freely navigate the Marketplace without the need to log in, but it's recomended to log in while browsing the Marketplace for an enhanced experience. If you want to log in, you can use any of the available options like Gmail, Discord, or using Wallets like Metamask.

## LANDs Map View

The Atlas view gives you a birdâ€™s-eye perspective of every color-coded parcel, Estate, road, district, and plaza in Decentraland.

You can click and drag the map to move around, zoom in and out, or hover your cursor over a parcel to see its x,y location and owner.

Any parcel that is currently for sale or rent in the Marketplace will be highlighted.

Click on a parcel to view its status, coordinates, and ownerâ€™s public wallet address (if it has an owner). From the map view, you can click on any LAND to go to see its details, buy it, make an offer to buy it, and even rent it. 

## Browsing

- Select the **Category** to view all the Wearables and Emotes types.

- **Filter** items by name, rarity, price, and more to find exaclty what you are looking for.


## Buy MANA or Pay With Your Local Currency

You can purchase Wearables, Emotes, and NAMEs with debit or credit cards, or with bank transfer (availability depends on your location). Or you can buy "Ehtereum MANA" to purchase LAND, NAMEs, and some special Wearables. Or you can buy "Polygon MANA" to purchase most Wearables and Emotes.

## Make an offer for an item

If an item isn't listed on sale, you can still place a _bid_ on it and offer to buy it at a specific price. The other steps of the process are just like those of buying an item.

{{< hint info >}}
**ðŸ’¡ Tip**:  View items that aren't for sale by untoggling the _On sale_ option. For LAND and Estates, you can also browse using the _Atlas_ view and select any parcel.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**:  If this is your first time placing a bid on the Marketplace, you will also be asked to confirm a one-time transaction to allow the Marketplace to handle bids.

To view a list of your open and pending bids, select _My Assets_ > _Bids_ on the tabs above.


## Sell a parcel or Estate

To sell one of your items:

1. Open **My Assets** and open its details page.
2. In the details page, click **Sell**.
3. Set a price and expiration date and click **List for sale**. Then retype the price you're selling it at to confirm.
4. Confirm this transaction on your wallet and wait for the network to verify it.

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**:  If this is your first time selling an item of this asset type on the Marketplace, you will also be asked to confirm a one-time transaction to allow the Marketplace to accept MANA.
{{< /hint >}}


You can change the price of a sale that you already put on sale without having to cancel and re-create the listing. Just click **Update price** in the parcel or Estate's details page.



## Transfer LAND

To transfer a LAND parcel or Estate to another user:

1. Open **My Assets** and open the details page of the parcel or the Estate you'd like to transfer and click **Transfer**.

2. Enter the public address of the Ethereum wallet of the recipient.

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**:  Please double check this address, since you cannot cancel the operation. While the recipient could always transfer the LAND back to you, the original owner cannot reverse the action.
{{< /hint >}}

3. Click **Submit**.
4. Confirm this transaction on your Ethereum client and wait for the network to verify it.

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**:  If the LAND parcel or Estate is currently on sale, you won't be able to transfer it. First click **Remove listing** to cancel the sale.
