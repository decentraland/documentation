It would be easier to ask what you _can't_ create in Decentraland! As a virtual world created by its users, in Decentraland you can create just about everything you see.
Decentraland Creators make all the components that go into crafting a digital identity, such as [Wearables]({{< ref "/content/creator/wearables-and-emotes/wearables/wearables-overview.md" >}}) (this can include whole skins, body parts, articles of clothing, hair styles, accessories, etc.) as well as [Emotes]({{< ref "/content/creator/wearables-and-emotes/emotes/emotes-overview.md" >}}), animations for your avatar which can include props and sounds in addition to movement.
The landscape and activities of Decentraland are also all shaped by creators. Walking through Decentraland's Genesis City, you can explore a variety of content from different creators, built side-by-side: art galleries, theaters, gardens, night clubs, racetracks, casinos, entire game experiences, and more can be explored and created by everyone! To start building, [download](https://decentraland.org/download/creator-hub) Decentraland's Creator Hub.

{{< details class="faq-details" anchor="true" title="Is it possible to monetize my creations?" >}}

Yes, of course! Decentraland creators are able to monetize their skills in many ways:

- Wearable and Emote creators earn 97.5% of the profits on all primary sales and 2.5% royalties on any secondary sales after publishing their creations in the Marketplace paying a $100 USD [**publication fee**]({{< ref "/content/creator/wearables-and-emotes/publishing/publishing-collections.md#publication-fees" >}})
- Scene creators are free to monetize their in-world experiences and retain 100% of the revenue they generate
- Creators can offer their services for hire on [**Decentraland Studios**](https://studios.decentraland.org/) .

{{< details class="faq-details" anchor="true" title="Does Decentraland take a cut from creator earnings?" >}}

As a decentralized platform with no centralized entity looking to
make a profit, Decentraland’s revenue-share model puts creators first. Decentraland
creators keep **97.5%** of the earnings from sales of their items—the highest revenue-share of any platform in the industry to date—and additionally earn **2.5%** royalties
on secondary sales.
The 2.5% withheld from creator earnings is the transaction fee that is associated
with any sale in the Marketplace. This fee is collected in Decentraland’s DAO
treasury to be reinvested into the platform through community initiatives or to cover
operational costs.

{{< details class="faq-details" anchor="true" title="Do I need to own LAND to build in Decentraland?" >}}

Not necessarily. Anyone is free to create content (scenes and interactive experiences) with Decentraland’s [**Creator Hub**](https://decentraland.org/download/creator-hub/) —once it’s time to publish your creations in-world, there are multiple options available besides owning LAND. 

- **Worlds:** Worlds are your personal 3D space in the metaverse. The exist separately from the open-world map of Decentraland’s Genesis City and are perfect for those looking to experiment with 3D creation or host their own virtual space. You can get your own when you [get a Decentraland NAME](https://decentraland.org/marketplace/names/claim). Learn more about NAMEs [**here**](https://decentraland.org/blog/about-decentraland/decentraland-worlds-your-own-virtual-space) .
- **Rent LAND:** If you want to publish in Decentraland’s open-world Genesis City but don’t want to commit to a LAND purchase, you don’t have to! It’s easy to rent LAND for the short or long term in the Marketplace where you can pay by card, bank transfer, or cryptocurrency. [**Browse rentals**](https://decentraland.org/marketplace/lands?assetType=nft&section=land&vendor=decentraland&page=1&sortBy=newest&onlyOnRent=true) to see what’s available.
- **Open Calls for Creators:** The Foundation often announces **[Open Calls](https://twitter.com/decentraland/status/1704918402907726030)** to collaborate with creators to build experiences and scenes for various Decentraland events such as the annual music, art, and fashion festivals. Stay tuned to Decentraland [**socials**](https://twitter.com/decentraland) or [**subscribe**](https://decentraland.beehiiv.com/subscribe) to the weekly newsletter to stay updated!
- **Community Magic:** If you’re passionate about sharing your creations with the community, in Decentraland there will always be a way to make it happen. The creator community is very welcoming and helpful. If you’re just getting started, join the  [**Community Building Discord](https://discord.gg/cbdcl)**  to start making connections.

{{< details class="faq-details" anchor="true" title="Can I control who can see the content of my World or LAND?" >}}

Yes. World permissions can be accessed at [decentraland.org/builder/worlds](https://decentraland.org/builder/worlds). Here you can restrict public access and create a customized list of up to 100 accounts that are allowed to visit your World. From here you can also grant editing and streaming permissions for your World.
For restricting access to your LAND: You can control how certain content on your parcel is served to other users within the Decentraland network. For example, you could make 3D models, images, video, or sound content only visible to a player in Decentraland after they have submitted a payment or fulfilled some other requirement. However, remember that by uploading content to Decentraland’s content servers, you are essentially making it publicly available since the content servers are a distributed file system.
You can control who you can see and interact with (and who can see and interact with you) within Decentraland. For example, imagine that you have a house on your parcel and you only want to invite certain friends into your house. You will be able to specify which players you can see (and which players can see you) within your house, but you won’t necessarily be able to prevent anyone from seeing your house or its contents since the assets required to render your house reside on the content server.
