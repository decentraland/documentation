- **Is it ok to share my wallet address?**
  Yes, your wallet address, a unique sting of numbers and letters, is like a bank account number. Others can use it to send you gifts, like a Wearable, but not to take items from you.
  You can find your Decentraland account wallet address by clicking on your profile in-world or when you’re logged in on decentraland.org. It will be under your avatar’s name.
- **Someone wants to send me an item for free—is it a scam?**
  Sending gifts of Wearables or Emotes is a common tradition in Decentraland, so this should not automatically register as a red flag. For someone to send you a gift, they will need your wallet address, a unique string of numbers and letters, but data this alone is not something that can be used to scam you. If someone sends you a gift using your wallet address, it should appear in your Backpack without any necessary action from you.
  What you should **never** give out is your ‘seed phrase’ (this applies if your Decentraland account is linked to an external digital wallet).
- **What are the most common scams to look out for?**
  One of the most common scams are websites, social accounts, emails, and DMs impersonating Decentraland and advertising a free airdrop of MANA. This is something Decentraland will **NEVER** do.
  Another common tactic is pretending to be a potential client and sending a file containing a virus. Always be very cautious with messages from people you don’t know personally and **never** download files from them.

  A good rule is to always take the time to verify urls and email addresses before taking any actions. True Decentraland websites will always have the base [decentraland.org](http://decentraland.org) and the weekly newsletter will only come from hello@decentraland.org.

- **What should I do if my account/digital wallet has been compromised?**
  If you've unfortunately been the victim of account compromise and notice your wallet has been drained, there are a few things you should do next, depending on how the hack occurred:
  - If you have any remaining assets in your wallet, you can try to transfer them to a new, uncompromised account immediately and discontinue using the compromised wallet completely. Create your new wallet from a different device in case the virus is still present on your computer.
  - If the hack occurred through a downloaded file, you’ll want to wipe your PC completely to remove any malware.
  - Regardless of how the hack occurred, you can report the incident to your local authorities. This can not only help with the investigation—given local legislation—but also assist in creating a police report, which can be useful for flagging compromised assets on platforms like Opensea.
  After securing your assets and ensuring your devices are clean, you can create a new Decentraland account and get back to exploring.
