  And yes you can edit event details after publishing!
- **How does the event review process work?**
  Review times depend on day/time of event submission, but won’t take longer than a few hours. Events are reviewed by the team at the Decentraland Foundation. Add your email or Discord username so you can be contacted if necessary.
- **My event wasn’t published, why not?**
  Your event may not have passed review because you did not fill in all the required information. Make sure you complete every field in the form when submitting an event.
