  You can easily copy the wallet address associated with your Decentraland account in-world or from decentraland.org.
  In-world, click on your profile picture in the top left, and your wallet address will be under your avatar’s name. Online, make sure you’re logged in, then open your profile. You wallet address will be under your avatar’s name.
