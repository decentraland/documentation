Did you know that you can also play Decentraland directly on your Meta Quest by sideloading the app through SideQuest?! If you don't already use SideQuest, this section will walk you through how to set it up, and use it to sideload the Decentraland app directly onto your headset.

## Get SideQuest

 - To get started visit SideQuest's website and look at ["Get SideQuest"](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto). This page will give you all the information on how to set up an account and download SideQuest. 
 {{< hint warning >}}
 **📔 Note**:  You will need to enable developer mode onto your headset before you will be able to sideload apps. To do this, if you haven't already, you will need to first set up a developer account with Meta. These instructions should be outlined in the SideQuest setup documentation, but you can also follow Meta's instructions [here.](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/)

- Connect your headset to the computer with a USB-C cable. 
     > *Double check that your headset is connected by looking to see if has the headset's name showing in the top left of your SideQuest window* (i.e. *"Oculus Quest 2"*). 

- Once it's connected, in SideQuest, press the "Download App (SideLoad)" button to download the app on your headset. The app will notify you of when the install is completed.

## Play the Game!

- After the app has been downloaded, put on your headset and open the universal menu. Navigate to you App Library and open it.

- Head to the dropdown on the top furthest to the right, and switch to the the "Unknown Sources" section. Note that all of you sideloaded apps will appear under this section.
