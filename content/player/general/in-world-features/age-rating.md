# Age Rating and Scene Reporting

This section provides guidance on managing content settings in Decentraland, specifically focusing on enabling adult content and the importance of reporting inaccurately categorized scenes.

### Age Rating

To maintain a safe and suitable environment for its community, Decentraland utilizes an age rating system. Scenes can be categorized into two main ratings for this purpose:

- **ðŸŸ¢ `T` for Teens (13+)**: This is the minimum age requirement as per the [Terms of Use](https://decentraland.org/terms/#8-children). Scenes may contain moderate violence, suggestive or horror-themed content, simulated gambling, and mild language. 
- **ðŸŸ¡ `A` for Adults (18+)**: Scenes may include intense offensive language, graphic violence, explicit sexual content and/or nudity, real money gambling, and substances like alcohol, tobacco, and drugs.

### Enabling Adult Content
By default, adult content is disabled. To experience Decentraland without restrictions, activate the Adult Content setting in the Settings menu. You must verify that you are at least 18 years old to enable this feature.

1) Press `Tab` to open the Menu and navigate to the **Settings** section.

2) Find the **Adult Content** switch.

3) Confirm your age to activate **Adult Content**.

You can disable Adult Content at any other given moment.

### Restricted Scenes

There is a third category for scenes: ðŸ”´ `R` for Restricted. Content under this category won't load in the World. This rating is applied by Content Moderators to scenes that violate Decentraland's [Content Policy](https://decentraland.org/content). Violations may include, but are not limited to:

- Suspicious content or spam
- Abusive or hateful content
- Sexual or degrading content
- Child abuse
- Harassment or bullying
- Promotion of terrorism/violence
- IP/Copyright infringement

### Scene Reporting
Scene creators set the age rating during the publishing process. If you encounter a scene that seems incorrectly rated, you can report it for review by the Content Moderation team, currently managed by the Decentraland Foundation support team.

Here's how:

1) Locate the **Flag Scene** button.

2) Review the **Current Rate** of the scene.

3) Select in which category you thing it belongs.

4) Select which issues you found in the scene.

5) Submit the report

Reports are reviewed by the Content Moderation team, and scenes may be re-categorized if considered appropriate.
