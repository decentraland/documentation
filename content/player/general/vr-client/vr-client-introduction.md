<b>
The Decentraland VR Client allows the a user to experience this Metaverse from within virtual reality! 

</b>

This is where you will find instructions on how to set up and play Decentraland from your Meta Quest 2. In future sections, we will run through how to use Quest Link and the Oculus desktop app to play Decentraland on a PC/VR setup as well as show how you can side-load Decentraland directly onto you your Quest using SideQuest.

In certain ways, the decentraland VR-Client is not too different from the desktop version. In terms of how the world is setup, you will still be able to do things that other players can. The main difference is the way your viewing your environment (from within you headset), and how you interact with the world around you (with controllers instead of a keyboard and mouse).

### **User Controls**

### **Known Issues**

- Many scenes were not created with VR experiences in mind, and may not be fully playable as a VR experience. This may mean that certain elements may not interact correctly with controllers, or objects that can be picked up may be placed awkwardly. Some objects may respond to a trigger click, while others may only respond to X (E) or Y (F).

- You can modify settings within the Decentraland settings menu, such as the graphics settings to acheive better quality, but some settings such as Bloom will cause rendering issues, especially around Genesis Plaza.  Other settings such as Parcel Load Radius can be raised, but increases the amount of models in memory and can lead to low frame rate, instability and crashing on Android.
