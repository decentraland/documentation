# Using the Quest App

  Meta has already created some articles and documentation on many of the features of the Quest 2. To set up Air Link, 


  - Visit the [Meta Quest Link page](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/) page and scroll down to the "Air Link" section. 

  - The dropdown titled "Connect Meta Quest Pro or Meta Quest 2 to your PC with Air Link" has the instructions you need to get your Quest 2 set up with Air Link. It will also help you to set up with the Oculus App, which is a required dependency for Air Link. 
  
  - If you haven't already, open the Oculus app and navigate to the settings. Click on the "General" tab and check to see if Oculus is set to be the active OpenXR Runtime. If not, click "Set Oculus as Active."

  - After you have completed this, proceed to download the latest version of [DecentralandVR](https://sidequestvr.com/app/11626/decentraland-vr) on SideQuest by selecting "Download APP (PCVR)" on the download dropdown.

## Launch Quest Link and Play the Game
  Once you have completed the previous steps, you should be ready to launch the Air Link and play the game. Follow the steps listed below to do just that!



  - Open your universal Menu with the Oculus button on your right Touch controller. Navigate to your "Quick Settings" menu by hovering on the clock on the far left of the universal menu.

  -  Click on "Quest Link." Make sure that "Use Air Link" is enabled at the top.

  - Select your PC from the "Available PCs" list and click Pair. 

  -  You will see a pairing code appear in your headset. If you look back at your Oculus app, you should see the same pairing code. Click "Confirm" in the desktop app if it matches.

 **ðŸ“” Note**: If you do not see a paring code, ensure that your headset and desktop app are fully up to date.

  - Click "Launch" back in the headset to start using Air Link.

  - If you haven't already, unzip the DecentralandVR game file we downloaded earlier. Open the unzipped folder, and open the "DecentralandVR.exe" application.

 **ðŸ“” Note**: A window may pop up from windows defender saying that it blocked the app from opening since it was from an unknown publisher. Click "See More" or "More" and then click "Run Anyway."
