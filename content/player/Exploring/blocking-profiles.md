If you block a player in Decentraland, you will no longer see their avatar in-world, and they will not be able to send you friend requests or messages. You will also not see each other’s messages in public or private chats.

## How to Block a Profile

To block a player, open their profile card by clicking on their avatar and click on the three dots in the upper right corner above their avatar image, then select the option ‘Block’. You can also block someone within a chat by clicking on the three dots to the right of their name and selecting ‘Block’.

## How to Unblock a Profile

To unblock someone in-world, click on your profile picture in the top right corner of the screen, to open the Explorer menu then, click on your profile picture again to see the profile drop down and click on ‘Account Settings’. From there you will see the option, ‘Blocked Accounts’. Clicking on that, you will see any players you’ve blocked and can unblock them.
