Make sure you've [installed the Decentraland editor]({{< ref "/content/creator/editor/installation-guide.md" >}}).

1) Open your scene's folder using Visual Studio Code. 

> Note: The Visual Studio window must be at the root folder of the scene project.

2) Open the Editor's menu, by clicking the Decentraland logo on the tabs on the left. Then click **Publish scene**.

	This opens a new tab in Visual Studio, showing what parcels you're deploying to.

3) Approve the transaction

	- If the LAND tokens you own or have permissions are linked to a wallet you can use via Wallet Connect, click **Connect wallet**, then scan the QR code with your mobile device and follow the steps on Wallet Connect.
	- If you need to use Metamask on the browser, click **Open in Browser** to open this same window on a browser tab. Then approve the transaction on the Metamask browser extension.
