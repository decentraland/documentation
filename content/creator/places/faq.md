Below you can find the **frequently asked questions** about [Places](https://places.decentraland.org/).

## Editing your Place

**How do I edit the title, description or image of my Place?**

The title, description and image of your Place are taken from the scene metadata. Find out more about editing the [scene metadata](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/scene-metadata/).

**I updated the scene metadata but my Place has not been updated?**

Once your scene metadata is updated, you need to let us know so we can update your sceneâ€™s data in Places. You can get in touch on [Discord](https://decentraland.org/discord) in the [Places channel](https://discord.com/channels/417796904760639509/1043158908392443974).

## Highest Rated

**How is the highest rated percentage calculated?**

In order to avoid abuse, the highest rated percentage is calculated from upvotes and downvotes from users who have at least 100 [voting power](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/dao-userguide/#voting-power). Anyone can vote, but only qualifying votes are used to calculate the highest rated percentage.
