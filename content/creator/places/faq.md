Below you can find the **frequently asked questions** about [Places](https://places.decentraland.org/).

## Editing your Place

**How do I edit the title, description or image of my Place?**

The title, description and image of your Place are taken from the scene metadata. Find out more about editing the [scene metadata](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/scene-metadata/).

## Highest Rated

**How is the highest rated percentage calculated?**

In order to avoid abuse, the highest rated percentage is calculated from upvotes and downvotes from users who have at least 100 [voting power](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/dao-userguide/#voting-power). Anyone can vote, but only qualifying votes are used to calculate the highest rated percentage.

## Points of Interest

**How can my Place become a Point of Interest?**

Points of interest are notable locations in Decentraland. These “POIs” are promoted in several areas of the virtual world’s UI, and are promoted as good places for users to explore, especially people new to Decentraland.

You can create a [proposal](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/dao-userguide/#creating-a-proposal) in the [DAO](https://dao.decentraland.org/en/) to nominate your Place as a Point of Interest.
