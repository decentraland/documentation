# **What is the Wearables Editor? [#](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/wearables/wearables-editor-user-guide/#what-is-the-wearables-editor)**

The Wearables Editor is a tool within Decentraland’s Builder that allows you to upload, add metadata to, and publish your own custom wearables.

> Remember: these docs don’t explain how to create the models, meshes, and textures that make up wearables, they just explain how to use the Wearables Editor to upload and publish your wearables. For an intro on the actual wearable creation process, start here.

## **Logging in**

To start uploading and publishing your wearables, navigate to **[builder.decentraland.org](https://builder.decentraland.org/)**.

Click **Sign in**, and then **Connect** to log in with your Metamask or Fortmatic wallet. After signing in, click the **Collections** tab.

# Creating a Collection

Before you can upload a wearable or an emote, you must create a collection first. To do that, go to [https://builder.decentraland.org/](https://builder.decentraland.org/) and click on ***Collections***. If you don’t have any collections yet, click on the ***New Collection*** button, the one with an image of a folder. If you already have another collection, clikc on the ***+*** button and select ***New Collection***.

After clicking on the button, you will be asked to rename your collection, as shown bellow. In case you change your mind, you can edit the name of your collection at any point **before publishing**.

If you already have a collection and want to add more items to it, just click on Add Item and upload your file. You can add as many files as you want before publishing the collection.

Each item of the collection have:

- Name of the item: this name will be displayed when distributing your wearable on the marketplace.
- Description *(optional)*: A brief statement describing your item, this is displayed when distributing your wearable on the marketplace
- Category - the component of an avatar’s body that your wearable modifies.
- Rarity - the rarity determines the maximum number of NFTs you will be able to mint of your wearable after publication. This is the only property that cannot be modified after publishing a collection.
- Tags *(optional)*: descriptive words that users can use when searching or filtering for items. These are relevant to competitions or events!

## **Rarity**

The rarity of your item determines the total number of NFTs that can be minted. Rarity is the same for both emotes and wearables and you will be able to define it once you upload your file.
