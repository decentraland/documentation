# Uploading Emotes

Once you export your emote, you’ll have to upload it to the builder. This document will cover the process of uploading emotes.

## **Uploading Your File**

Remember that you need to create a collection before you can upload your file. If you don’t know how to do that, check [Creating a Collection](/creator/wearables-and-emotes/manage-collections/creating-a-collection.md). To upload your emote, just drag and drop the file on the **_New Item_** window or browse your computer. It will automatically detect if the file has any animation, identifying it as an emote.

You will be asked to enter a name for your emote, define its rarity, the category and the play mode. Below the thumbnail is shown the number of animation clips in your file, the length of the animation in seconds, the length in frames and the frame rate.

## **Rarity**

Add rarity of the emote:

| Rarity    | Number of Items |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Unique    | 1               |
| Mythic    | 10              |
| Legendary | 100             |
| Epic      | 1,000           |
| Rare      | 5,000           |
| Uncommon  | 10,000          |
| Common    | 100,000         |

## **Category**

Choose the category that best describe your emote.

- Dance
- Stunt
- Greetings
- Fun
- Poses
- Reactions
- Horror
- Miscellaneous

## **Play Mode**

There are currently two play modes: play once and loop. Play once, as the name says, means that your emote will only play once. Loop means that the emote will keep on playing forever until you input another action.

## **Custom Thumbnails**

For emotes, you don’t have to upload any images since the editor already has a built in tool to create a thumbnail. Just select the frame that best represents the action.

{{< hint warning >}}
People should be able to indentify what the animation is about through the thumbnail. If a front shot isn’t good enough, try rotating the model, zoom in or out, pan up or down, pick any frame from your clip. It’s really important that you select the best shot!

## **Setting the Price**

Next, you will have to set the price of your emote and the beneficiary address. This can all be edited later on, so don’t worry if you haven’t decided on the price yet. You can skip this for now by clicking on **_Skip_**. Or you can set whatever price you want, click on **_Save_** and edit that before you actually publish the emote.

Remember that when you mint wearables, they are minted directly on Matic/Polygon. When a user purchases your item, the transaction will be conducted in Matic/Polygon MANA.

You could also **_Make it Free_**, which means that the price will be set as 0 MANA and the beneficiary address will be null. Know that making it free (primary sale) does not prevent it from being sold at any price as a secondary sale.

Don’t forget to set the beneficiary address, which is the one that will receive the MANA from your sales. You can use any Ethereum address you like. To automatically fill in the address you are logged in with, click **_I’m the Beneficiary._**

# **The Editor**

Once you set a price or skip it, you will have the editor open. This is where you can check if the animation is playing well since a 3D avatar will be performing it.

By clicking on the icon at the lower left you will be able to edit the avatar. Click on the cilinder icon on the lower right to check if you animation is staying within the boundaries of height and space.

You can also edit the emote’s name, thumbnail, category, rarity and play mode, as well as add a description of the animation and add tags to it. Click on Save when you are done.

## **Description**

This is a brief statement describing your item that will be displayed in the marketplace.

## **Tags**

Tags are simply descriptive words that users can use when searching or filtering for items. These are relevant to competitions or events!

# **Testing in World**

Even after testing the animation in the editor, it’s important to check how it’s actually going to look like and behave in Decentraland. To test it in world, go to the Collections tab, select the desired collection and it will show all the items you have in it. Click on the three dots (**_…_**)next to the item you want to test and select **_See in world_**.

<img src="images/uploading-emotes/09_test_in_world.png" width="300" /> _To test in world, click on the three dots and select See in world._

Once you select See in world, a new tab will open on your browser and you will get this message.

<img src="images/uploading-emotes/10_goerli.png" width="300" /> _Switch to Goerli network to test your emote in world._

Click on Switch to Goerli and a popup from your wallet will show up asking to switch the network. Simply click on Switch Network and the new tab will automatically refresh. To test your emote, go in the backpack and select it.

## **Before Publishing**

Make sure to set the price properly, add a nice description and verify if all the information and settings are right. Double check the thumbnail too. If you’ve filled all the information necessary you will see **_Done_** as the status of your item.
