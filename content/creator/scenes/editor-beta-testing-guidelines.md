The Decentraland Editor is currently being tested as a beta release. We're gathering feedback from the community, to ensure the release doesn't present any major issues and that the experience of using it is good.

We encourage you to test and experiment with this editor as much as possible.

## Install the editor

See the [Installation guide]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/getting-started/installation-guide.md" >}}).

## About the Decentraland Editor

The Decentraland editor is an extension of Visual Studio Code, built for easing the experience of creating Decentraland scenes.

Ultimately the editor will offer many no-code options for placing items, and setting component parameters via graphical UIs. The first version of the editor aims for simplifying the experience of coding scenes by removing the command line from the list of tools you need to use. It offers UI options for:

- **Create projects**: Scaffold a new project of various types: scene, library, portable experience, and smart item.
- **Run scenes**: preview your scenes within VSCode, or launch in a browser. See [Run preiview]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/getting-started/preview-scene.md#using-the-editor" >}})
- **Publish scenes**: publish your scene to the world. See [Publishing]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/publishing/publishing.md#via-the-editor" >}}).
- **Manage dependencies**: add, remove, and list the libraries and dependencies that your project is using. See [Manage dependencies]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/libraries/manage-dependencies.md" >}}).
- **Preview models**: Open a gltf or .glb model to see an interactive preview.
