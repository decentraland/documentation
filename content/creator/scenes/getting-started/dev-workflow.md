## Install the Decentraland Editor

Make sure you have the Decentraland Editor installed. See the [Installation Guide]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/getting-started/installation-guide.md" >}}) for more details instructions.


## Design your experience

Think about how much space you need to take up, what kind of distribution, what kinds of mechanics you want players to be able to carry out, etc. The following documents can serve as a guide:


- [UX & UI Guide]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/design-experience/ux-ui-guide.md" >}})
- [Design constraints for games]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/design-experience/design-games.md" >}})
- [Scene MVP guidelines]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/design-experience/mvp-guidelines.md" >}})

## Where to publish

You don't need land to develop a scene, but you will need access to land once you're ready to publish.

The following options are available:

- Rent LAND
- Purchase LAND
- Obtain permissions from a land owner
- Publish to a Decentraland World, see [worlds]({{< ref "/content/creator/worlds/about.md" >}}) to learn more.
	> NOTE: The Worlds feature is still in beta.

See [Publishing options]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/publishing/publishing-options.md" >}}) for more details.


## Templates and examples

When creating a new scene, chose amongst several base template scenes that include some basic code and 3d models. Use these to get started faster.

Check out the [awesome repository](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/Awesome-Repository) for a large collection of example scenes, each showcasing different mechanics that you can borrow. You can also clone any of these scenes and use it as a starting point.

Also check out [helper libraries](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/Awesome-Repository#Libraries) that simplify many common tasks.

## Art assets

If you're an experienced artist or you have access to someone who is, you can cerate custom `.gltf` or `.glb` models for your scene. See [3D model essentials]({{< ref "/content/creator/3d-modeling/3d-models.md" >}}) for tips on how to create 3D models for Decentraland.

There are many sources to obtain free or paid art assets. For example:

- [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/)
- [Clara.io](https://clara.io/)
- [Archive3D](https://archive3d.net/)
- [SketchUp 3D Warehouse](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/)
- [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) (3D models made primarily for 3D printing, but adaptable to Virtual Worlds)
- [ShareCG](https://www.sharecg.com/)
- [CGTrader](https://CGTrader.com)

## Run a local preview

To run a preview of your scene, open a Visual Studio Code window on your project's root folder and click the **Preview** button on the Decentraland Editor tab.

See [Preview your scene]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/getting-started/preview-scene.md" >}}) ) for more details. Check the [Debug a scene]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/getting-started/preview-scene.md#debug-a-scene" >}})) for tips on how to debug any issues.

> TIP: If you get stuck trying to debug an issue, visit the [Decentraland Discord server](https://dcl.gg/discord) to get help from other developers.

_Optional_: Your scen`s might mechanics might rely on a 3rd party server to carry out player validations, permanent data storage, or other functionalities. See ...link?

## Publish to the test server

Deploy your scene to a test server. This server is not private but only accessible via a specific URL, so players won't bump into your tested scene involuntarily.

See [Publish to the test server]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/publishing/publishing.md#the-test-server" >}}) for instructions and more info.

## Publish to Decentraland

Once you're happy with your scene, it's time to publish it to the production environment. There all players will have access to it if they visit the scene's coordinates.

See [Publish to prod]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/publishing/publishing.md#to-publish-the-scene" >}}) for instructions and more info.

> NOTE: Before you do, check that your scene has all the necessary metadata: name, description, a preview image, spawn points. See [scene metadata]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/projects/scene-metadata.md" >}}) for details.


## Promote

Once your scene is out there, you want to give it visibility and have people visit it. There are a number of ways you can shine a spotlight on it:

- Share it on social media
- Create an event in the [events page](https://events.decentraland.org/en/)
- Promote that people vote for it in the [Places page](https://places.decentraland.org/)
- Make a proposal in the DAO to mark your scene as a [Point Of Interest (POI)]({{< ref "/content/player/dao/dao-user-guide.md#binding-proposals" >}})


## Iterate

One great advantage of Decentraland is that you can easily iterate over your scenes. Measure your scene's success with players, then keep publishing changes as you perfect the experience for your players.

See [Scene analytics]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/other/scene-analytics.md" >}}) for more information.


## Giving back

Decentraland is a community project, the community of creators learns together and leverag each other's creations. Consider the following:

- Join the [Decentraland Discord server](https://dcl.gg/discord) and help other developers in need of advice.
- Share your scene's code as an open soruce repo on GitHub.
- Build a minimal example to share a specific reusable mechanic, as an open soruce repo on GitHub.
- Make a PR to the Awesome Repository to include your scenes.
- Write a library that encapsulates the complexity of common challenges, so others can overcome them easily.
