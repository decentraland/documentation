Decentraland Cast is a specialized tool tailored for world owners and other authorized individuals. It offers the capability to stream camera footage or share screens seamlessly within their world.

## Streaming

At the moment, streaming via [Decentraland Cast](https://cast.decentraland.org) is an exclusive feature reserved for world owners and individuals who possess deployment rights. For more details on these rights, refer to the [ACL]({{< ref "/creator/worlds/about.md#access-control-lists-acl" >}}) section.

If authorized, users have the option to either activate their cameras or share their screens directly within the app.

A notable feature of the Decentraland Cast web application is its flawless integration with the world. This ensures that irrespective of whether you are connected via the world itself or the Cast app, communication remains uninterrupted. Users can effortlessly send, receive, and listen to chat and voice messages.

## Other users in the cast app

While users can readily join the Decentraland Cast application, those lacking streaming authorization will find their capabilities restricted. Specifically, they will not have permissions to broadcast any data, whether it be video, voice chat, or text messaging.

## Scene

A scene should be deployed in the world with the ability to handle video streams. To delve deeper into the specifics of this integration, please consult the [Decentraland SDK]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/media/video-playing.md#streaming-using-decentraland-cast" >}}) documentation.
