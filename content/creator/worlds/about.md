In this document you will learn how to use Decentraland Worlds BETA, a new service that lets you deploy isolated scenes that you can access with the Decentraland Explorer and using your digital identity.  

The name **Worlds** was given to scenes that exist outside the Genesis City boundaries. Worlds can be used to do experiments, create new experiences, as scenes portfolio or even as a Scene Preview Service to test the content before uploading it to the Genesis City. Worlds scenes are attached to [Decentraland NAMEs](https://builder.decentraland.org/names) (a `NAME NFT` within the DCL ecosystem that can be assigned to your avatar or LAND and costs 100 MANA to create or can be purchased from a previous owner in the Marketplace) and the NAMEs are used to tell Decentraland Explorer which World to load.  

### WARNINGS: The Worlds Service is in BETA state

Consider that this product is in BETA state before making it a key part of your product road map.  

The BETA is open to anyone to use, to kick-off the product and be able to assess the scaling, a World scene must meet the following limitations: 
- Scenes have no parcel limitations since January 2023
- 100 MB is the maximum size for the scene deployment 
- Up to 100 users will be allowed to join a World scene concurrently  

### Publish a World 

The starting point for this product is having a scene that meets the size requirements mentioned above. If you wish to know more about how to create a scene, check out the [Decentraland SDK](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/sdk-101/) documentation.

If you are a Content Creator, you may be already familiar with how the [CLI](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/sdk-101/) works, the experience is quite similar, but with two small caveats... 

You need to specify under which NAME that deployment is to be made. In your
`scene.json` you need to add the following section:

```json
{
  "worldConfiguration" : {
    "name": "my-name.dcl.eth"
  }
}
```

Of course, the NAME specified there needs to be owned by the wallet signing the deployment.

And secondly, you need to specify the target server in the deployment command-line and use the Worlds Content Server URL: 

```bash
dcl deploy --target-content https://worlds-content-server.decentraland.org`
```


Once you run the command, you will be prompted to sign the deployment with your wallet and a set of validations will be executed to allow or reject the scene: 
- The wallet signing the deployment must own the Decentraland NAME specified in the scene.json file 
- The scene has no parcel limitations (since January 2023)
- The total size of the scene must be less or equal to 100 MB

### Joining a World 

Once a scene is uploaded to the Worlds server you can access it by using the 
Decentraland Explorer with the following friendly URL `https://play.decentraland.org/world/NAME`, where `NAME` should be replaced by the Decentraland NAME to which the deployment was done to. You may use the NAME with or without the `.dcl.eth` suffix.

On the other hand, NAMEs also work as realms, so you can leverage the existing change realm mechanisms to access a world. One way would be by typing the `/changerealm NAME.dcl.eth` command in the chatbox and another possibility is by changing the query parameter in the Explorer URL: if your NAME is `my-name.dcl.eth` you can use the following URL to access the world: `https://play.decentraland.org/?realm=my-name.dcl.eth` 

### Migrating a World to the Genesis City  

If you are a LAND owner and you wish to deploy a World scene to the Genesis City, it is completely possible. You just need to re-deploy your scene to the decentralized Catalyst network, the targeted content server for Genesis City

Things to remember:
* remove the `worldConfiguration` section from `scene.json`
* the size limitation for Worlds (100 MB, an average of 25MB per parcel) is larger than that for LAND parcels (15MB a parcel), so make sure your scene is sized correctly for deployments to Genesis City!
