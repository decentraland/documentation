The Creator Hub plus custom code is a very powerful combination for creating content. You can use the canvas to visually position items intuitively, and then write code that interacts with these items with complete freedom. You can even place a smart item, that has its own default behavior, and write code that reacts to when the item is activated.

For example, you can take advantage of an existing lever smart item, that already comes with its sounds and animations and states, and write code that detects when the lever is pulled to run your own custom logic.

Click the **< > CODE** button to open Visual Studio Code on your scene project.

This opens a separate window with Visual Studio Code. On the left margin you can navigate the files and folder structure of your project.

## Reference an item

When using the Scene Editor and adding entities by dragging them into the canvas, each entity has a unique name. Use the `engine.getEntityOrNullByName()` function to reference one of these entities from your code. Pass the entity's name as a string, as written on the scene's entity tree view in the Scene Editor.

```ts
function main() {
	const door = engine.getEntityOrNullByName('Pot1')
}
```

<img src="/images/editor/check-name.png" width="600" />

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**: Make sure you only use `engine.getEntityOrNullByName()` inside the `main()` function, in functions that run after `main()`, or in a system. If used outside one of those contexts, the entities created in the Scene Editor may not yet be instanced.
{{< /hint >}}

You're free to perform any action on an entity fetched via this method, like add or remove components, modify values of existing components, or remove the entity from the engine.

```ts
function main() {
	// fetch entity
	const door = engine.getEntityOrNullByName('door-3')
	// verify that the entity exists
	if (door) {
		// add a pointer events callback
		pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
			{
				entity: door,
				opts: { button: InputAction.IA_PRIMARY, hoverText: 'Open' },
			},
			function () {
				// open door
			}
		)
	}
}
```

All the entities added via the Scene Editor have a `Name` component, you can also iterate over all of them like this:

```ts
function main() {
	for (const [entity, name] of engine.getEntitiesWith(Name)) {
		console.log({ entity, name })
	}
}
```

## Smart item triggers

You can detect a smart item's **Trigger events**, and respond to these with custom code. For example, you could place a button smart item, and activate custom code when the button is clicked.

Use `getTriggerEvents` to fetch an object that can handle trigger events on from a particular smart item, then use the `.on()` function of the returned object to subscribe a callback function. This callback function gets executed every time that the trigger event happens.

For example, if a scene has a button with the following generic **On Click** event, you can write the code below to run custom code whenever the button is activated.

<img src="/images/editor/restart-button.png" width="600" />

```ts
import { getTriggerEvents, getActionEvents } from '@dcl/asset-packs/dist/events'
import { TriggerType } from '@dcl/asset-packs'

function main() {
	const restart = engine.getEntityOrNullByName('Restart_Button')
	if (restart) {
		const restart_event = getTriggerEvents(restart)
		restart_event.on(TriggerType.ON_CLICK, () => {
			// restartGame()
		})
	}
}
```

You can similarly subscribe to any other type of trigger events, like **ON_PLAYER_ENTERS_AREA**, **ON_SPAWN**, **ON_TWEEN_END**, etc.

<!--
You can also use custom code to activate trigger events based on your own custom logic. The following example triggers a door's **On Click** trigger event. Any actions called by that event will be executed. In this case, the door will open or close.

<img src="/images/editor/door-triggers.png" width="600" />

```ts
import { getTriggerEvents, getActionEvents } from '@dcl/asset-packs/dist/events'
import { TriggerType } from '@dcl/asset-packs'

function main() {
	const door = engine.getEntityOrNullByName('Wooden Door')
	if (door) {
		const door_events = getTriggerEvents(door)
		door_events.emit(TriggerType.ON_CLICK)
	}
}
``` -->

## Smart item actions

You can detect the activation of a smart item's **Actions**, and respond to these with custom code. For example, you could place a door smart item, and run custom code whenever the **Open** action gets called.

Use `getActionEvents` to fetch an object for handling the actions of a specific smart item. Then you can use the `.on()` function of the returned object to subscribe a callback function. This callback function gets executed every time that the action happens, regardless of if the action was activated by another smart item, or even by custom code of your own.

For example, if a scene has a door with the following default **Open** action, you can write the code below to run custom code whenever the door is opened.

<img src="/images/editor/door-actions.png" width="600" />

```ts
import { getTriggerEvents, getActionEvents } from '@dcl/asset-packs/dist/events'
import { TriggerType } from '@dcl/asset-packs'

function main() {
	const door = engine.getEntityOrNullByName('Wooden Door')
	if (door) {
		// detect actions
		const actions = getActionEvents(door)
		actions.on('Open', () => {
			console.log('Door opened!!')
			// custom code
		})

		// detect triggers
		const triggers = getTriggerEvents(door)
		triggers.on(TriggerType.ON_CLICK, () => {
			console.log('Door clicked!!')
			// custom code
		})
	}
}
```

You can also emit action events from your code, this allows you to take advantage of actions that are already defined inside the smart item's Action component. The following snippet calls the "Open" action on a door smart item whenever a button smart item is triggered.

```ts
import { getTriggerEvents, getActionEvents } from '@dcl/asset-packs/dist/events'
import { TriggerType } from '@dcl/asset-packs'

function main() {
	const button = engine.getEntityOrNullByName('Red Button')
	const door = engine.getEntityOrNullByName('Wooden Door')
	if (button && door) {

		// references to actions and triggers
		const buttonTriggers = getTriggerEvents(button)
		const doorActions = getActionEvents(door)

		// detect triggers on button
		buttonTriggers.on(TriggerType.ON_INPUT_ACTION, () => {
			// open door
			doorActions.emit("Open", {})
		})
	}
}
```

**ðŸ’¡ Tip**: If you're not trying to do something very complicated, instead of writing code you can also create a custom smart item to handle the actions you want to perform. See [Making any item smart]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/smart-items/make-any-item-smart.md" >}}).

## Version control

We recommend that you create a repo for your project on GitHub, and use it to keep track of your project's versions and to work collaboratively with others.

If you're not familiar with how to do this, see [Quickstart for repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories), or use the [GitHub desktop appliacation](https://desktop.github.com/download/) for an simpler UI-based flow.

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**: Upload the entire project folder to a GitHub repo, but make sure the `/node-modules` or `/bin` folders and the `package-lock.json` file are all included in the `.gitignore` file, to avoid syncing them. This should be the case if you configure the repo to be of type `node`. These files are all auto-generated, and the content may differ for different machines.
