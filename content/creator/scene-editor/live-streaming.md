You can stream your webcam or desktop to Decentraland. This is useful for live events, tutorials, or any other content that you want to share with others.

To do this, you need a streaming software that can output to an URL. Some popular choices are [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) and [XSplit](https://www.xsplit.com/).

On your scene, you will need to add an [Admin Tools smart item]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/scene-admin.md" >}}) and a [Video Screen smart item]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/smart-items/video-screen.md" >}}).

1. Add an [Admin tools]({{< ref "/creator/editor/scene-admin.md">}}) smart item to your scene, as well as a [Video player]({{< ref "/creator/editor/smart-items/play-videos.md">}}) smart item.

2. Publish your scene, either to a World or to Genesis City.
