If you have a scene created with the Web Editor, you can easily migrate it to the Creator Hub.

The Creator Hub is the recommended tool for creating Decentraland scenes. It has a much more polished interface and allows you to combine the easy drag-and-drop interface with the ability to customize further with code. It also allows you to run your scene preview using the latest desktop client.

## Export your project

To edit the code in a scene created with the Web Editor, you must export the scene to your machine and open it with the Creator Hub.

{{< hint warning >}}
**📔 Note**: If you don't have the Creator Hub installed, follow the steps in the following page before your start.

[Install Creator Hub]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/get-started/editor-installation.md" >}})
{{< /hint >}}

1. Click the **Download icon** on the top menu of the Web Editor while editing the scene.

  <img src="/images/editor/export.png" width="256" />

2. This will download a _.zip_ file, extract it.
3. Open the **Creator Hub**, go into the **Scene Editor** section.
4. Click the **Import** button and select the path to your exported project folder.

Once you're done, you can keep working on your project inside the Creator Hub, with a visual interface that looks a lot like the Web Editor, but much more polished.

You can also edit the files under the `/src` folder to add behavior with code to your scene. See [Combine with code]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/code/overview.md" >}}) for how to edit the code of your scene.
