The Creator Hub includes a powerful Scene Editor that combines a simple no-code interface with the ability to write code to customize your scenes further.

You can then select what template to use as a starting point. You can pick a blank scene or a project with some initial content.

See [Manage scenes]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/manage-scenes.md" >}}) for more details.

## Moving around

To find your way around the Scene Editor:

- Use **A** and **W** to move close or far. You can also use the mouse scroll wheel, or **+** and **-** keys
- Use **S** and **D** to move sideways.
- Click the mouse and drag to rotate. You can click either with the Right or the Left button.
- Press **Space bar** to reset the camera back to the default position

## Add items

Navigate the themed asset pack categories on the menu on the bottom to find different items that you can place on your scene.

Click and drag a selected item to move it freely around the scene at ground level. See [Scene editor essentials]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/scene-editor-essentials.md#position-items" >}}) for more details.

## Preview

To test your scene and experience it like a player, click the _Preview_ button on the top-right corner. This will open a new window with the Decentraland Desktop Explorer, running just your scene. There you can move around the scene and interact with interactive items.
