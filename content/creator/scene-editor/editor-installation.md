**📔 Note**:
The Creator Hub is currently in Alpha stage, and shared with users that join the [pre-release of the new Standalone Decentraland client](https://68zbqa0m12c.typeform.com/to/y9fZeNWm).

Once accepted into the alpha program, you'll be shared the installer for the Creator Hub.
{{< /hint >}}

Visit the [Create page in Decentraland.org](https://decentraland.org/create/) and download the **Creators Hub**.

## Updating the Creator Hub

No steps are required. The Creator Hub application checks for updates every time you open it, and self-updates if there's a new version available.

## Editing code

If you also plan on reading and editing code in your scene, you'll also need to install <img src="/images/editor/vscode.png" alt="Header" width="25"/> [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), if you don't have it already.

## Troubleshooting
