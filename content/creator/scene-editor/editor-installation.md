Download the Creator Hub [HERE](https://decentraland.org/download/creator-hub).

## Updating the Creator Hub

No steps are required. The Creator Hub application checks for updates every time you open it, and self-updates if there's a new version available.

## Editing code

If you also plan on reading and editing code in your scene, you'll also need to install <img src="/images/editor/vscode.png" alt="Header" width="25"/> [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), if you don't have it already.

You can instead try <img src="/images/editor/cursor-icon.jpg" alt="Header" width="25"/> [Cursor AI](https://www.cursor.com/), a powerful code editor that is integrated with AI. It lets you pick different AI models to help you write code, all of them are free.


## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, see the [troubleshooting]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/debugging/troubleshooting.md" >}}) section.
