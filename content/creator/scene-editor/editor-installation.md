To install the Scene Editor...

<!-- TODO
Mac Windows

-->

# Updating the Editor

No steps are required. The Scene Editor application checks for updates every time you open it, and self-updates if there's a new version available.

# Editing code

If you also plan on reading and editing code in your scene, you'll also need to install <img src="/images/editor/vscode.png" alt="Header" width="25"/> [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), if you don't have it already.

# Troubleshooting
