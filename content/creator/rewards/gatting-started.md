## Pre-Requirement

Before starting to use the Rewards Service, make sure you have a collection [approved and ready to mint]({{< ref "/creator/wearables-and-emotes/publishing/publishing-collections.md" >}}).

## Create your first campaign
A campaign refers to an incentivized initiative designed to boost user engagement through reward offerings. In this section, you'll discover the campaign configuration details, along with the prerequisites for initiating the distribution of rewards.
Enter to the [Rewards Service](https://rewards.decentraland.org/), connect your wallet, click on the **Campaigns** tab, and finally click on the **Create Campaign** button. You will be redirected to the campaign creation page.

- Campaign name will help you to identify your campaign on the list of campaigns and will be shown to the users on they rewards page.
- Campaign network is the network where your wearables will be minted, it can't be changed once the campaign is created.
- Max gas price is the maximum gas price you are willing to pay for each transaction. If the gas price exceeds the maximum gas price, the transaction will be deferred until the gas price is lower. You will also see an estimation of how much it will cost to mint each item.

Once you have filled the form, click on the **Create Campaign** button. You will be redirected to the campaign page.

In order to start delivering rewards, you need:

- Add MATIC to pay for transaction fees
- Add items to the campaign stock
- Create a dispenser to deliver the rewards
- Activate your campaign

### Add MATIC to pay for transaction fees

In order to mint items, you need to pay for the transaction fees and to do it, you need to add MATIC to the campaign address which you can find below its name.

To send MATIC from your wallet, make sure you are connected to the same network as the campaign, then copy the campaign address and send MATIC to it. If you don't have any MATIC on your wallet, you can follow [this guide]({{< ref "/content/player/blockchain-integration/transactions-in-polygon.md" >}}#where-can-i-get-matic-to-pay-for-transaction-fees) to get some. In case your campaign is running on **MUMBAI** network you can get some MATIC from [this faucet](https://mumbaifaucet.com/).

To send MATIC from an exchange you just need to withdraw MATIC token to the Polygon Network (usually Mumbai Network is not available on exchanges)

## Add items to the campaign stock

When you create a new campaign it doesn't have any item on its stock, so you need to add some items to it before you can start delivering rewards.

Rewards cannot be distributed through a campaign without granting minting permissions first, to do it, follow [this guide]({{< ref "/content/creator/wearables-and-emotes/publishing/publishing-collections.md" >}}#adding-minters-to-the-collection) using the campaign address (which you can find below its name) as the minters address.

Once you have granted minting permissions, and the transaction is confirmed, you can add items to the campaign stock. To do it, click on the **Add supply** button to see all collections the campaign has minting permissions on.

Select the collection item you want to add stock, and click on the **Add supply** button.

## Create a dispenser to deliver the rewards

Dispensers are the way to send or claim rewards from the stock, each one has a key that you need to authenticate against the HTTP API. The UI doesn't show any key, but you can get it by clicking on the **Copy** button.

Upon creating a new campaign, a default dispenser with a "master key" is provided for testing purposes only. To establish a new dispenser, simply click the **Add dispenser** button.

## Activate your campaign

By default your campaign is inactive, this prevents that the service assign rewards to users but is still sending rewards if there are any pending. To activate your campaign, click on the **Activate campaign** button.
