The Decentraland Editor plus custom code is a very powerful combination for creating content. You can use the Visual Editor to position items intuitively, and then write code that interacts with these items with complete freedom. You can even place a smart item, that has its own default behavior, and write code that reacts to when the item is activated.

For example, you can take advantage of an existing lever smart item, that already comes with its sounds and animations and states, and write code that detects when the lever is pulled to run your own custom logic.

## Export to desktop

To edit the code in a scene created with the [web editor]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/web-editor/web-editor.md" >}}), you must export the scene to the Desktop Editor.

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**: If you don't have the Desktop Editor installed, follow the steps in the following page before your start.

[Install Desktop Editor]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/getting-started/installation-guide.md" >}})
{{< /hint >}}

1. Click the **Download icon** on the top menu while editing the scene.

2. This will download a _.zip_ file, extract it.
3. Open the extracted folder with Visual Studio Code. The folder must be open at the root of the project.

Once you're done, you can edit the files under the `/src` folder to add behavior with code to your scene. You can also open the **Visual Editor** to keep editing items visually, just like in the web editor.

## Reference an item

When using the Decentraland Editor and adding entities via the drag-and-drop Visual Editor, each entity has a unique name. Use the `engine.getEntityOrNullByName()` function to reference one of these entities from your code. Pass the entity's name as a string, as written on the Visual Editor's UI, in the tree view on the left.

```ts
function main() {
	const door = engine.getEntityOrNullByName('Pot1')
}
```

<img src="/images/editor/check-name.png" width="600" />

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**: Make sure you only use `engine.getEntityOrNullByName()` inside the `main()` function, in functions that run after `main()`, or in a system. If used outside one of those contexts, the entities created in the Visual Editor may not yet be instanced.
{{< /hint >}}

You're free to perform any action on an entity fetched via this method, like add or remove components, modify values of existing components, or remove the entity from the engine.

```ts
function main() {
	// fetch entity
	const door = engine.getEntityOrNullByName('door-3')
	// verify that the entity exists
	if (door) {
		// add a pointer events callback
		pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
			{
				entity: door,
				opts: { button: InputAction.IA_PRIMARY, hoverText: 'Open' },
			},
			function () {
				// open door
			}
		)
	}
}
```

All the entities added via the Visual Editor have a `Name` component, you can also iterate over all of them like this:

```ts
function main() {
	for (const [entity, name] of engine.getEntitiesWith(Name)) {
		console.log({ entity, name })
	}
}
```

## Smart item triggers

You can detect a smart item's **Trigger events**, and respond to these with custom code. For example, you could place a button smart item, and activate custom code when the button is clicked.

Use `getTriggerEvents` to fetch an object that can handle trigger events on from a particular smart item, then use the `.on()` function of the returned object to subscribe a callback function. This callback function gets executed every time that the trigger event happens.

For example, if a scene has a button with the following generic **On Click** event, you can write the code below to run custom code whenever the button is activated.

<img src="/images/editor/restart-button.png" width="600" />

```ts
import { getTriggerEvents, getActionEvents } from '@dcl/asset-packs/dist/events'
import { TriggerType } from '@dcl/asset-packs'

function main() {
	const restart = engine.getEntityOrNullByName('Restart_Button')
	if (restart) {
		const restart_event = getTriggerEvents(restart)
		restart_event.on(TriggerType.ON_CLICK, () => {
			// restartGame()
		})
	}
}
```

You can similarly subscribe to any other type of trigger events, like **ON_PLAYER_ENTERS_AREA**, **ON_SPAWN**, **ON_TWEEN_END**, etc.

<!--
You can also use custom code to activate trigger events based on your own custom logic. The following example triggers a door's **On Click** trigger event. Any actions called by that event will be executed. In this case, the door will open or close.

<img src="/images/editor/door-triggers.png" width="600" />

```ts
import { getTriggerEvents, getActionEvents } from '@dcl/asset-packs/dist/events'
import { TriggerType } from '@dcl/asset-packs'

function main() {
	const door = engine.getEntityOrNullByName('Wooden Door')
	if (door) {
		const door_events = getTriggerEvents(door)
		door_events.emit(TriggerType.ON_CLICK)
	}
}
``` -->

## Smart item actions

You can detect the activation of a smart item's **Actions**, and respond to these with custom code. For example, you could place a door smart item, and run custom code whenever the **Open** action gets called.

Use `getActionEvents` to fetch an object for handling the actions of a specific smart item. Then you can use the `.on()` function of the returned object to subscribe a callback function. This callback function gets executed every time that the action happens, regardless of if the action was activated by another smart item, or even by custom code of your own.

For example, if a scene has a door with the following generic **Open** action, you can write the code below to run custom code whenever the door is opened.

<img src="/images/editor/door-actions.png" width="600" />

```ts
import { getTriggerEvents, getActionEvents } from '@dcl/asset-packs/dist/events'

function main() {
	const door = engine.getEntityOrNullByName('Wooden Door')
	if (door) {
		const actions = getActionEvents(door)
		actions.on('Open', () => {
			// custom code
		})
	}
}
```

**ðŸ’¡ Tip**: If you're not trying to do something very complicated, instead of writing code you can also create a custom smart item to handle the actions you want to perform. See [Making any item smart]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/web-editor/smart-items.md#making-any-item-smart" >}})
