Decentraland offers a vast array of content. You must ensure your scene stands out and connects with its audience. Here are some key strategies:

- **Social media:** Share your scene on social media platforms to increase its visibility. Decentraland's Discord server is also an excellent platform to engage with the community.
- **Categories and tags**: Utilize categories and tags to help players find your scene through the search feature on the Decentraland map. Learn more about this in [Categories]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/projects/scene-metadata.md#categories" >}}).
- **Visual Appeal**: Design your scene to be visually appealing from a distance to catch the eye of explorers. Consider how your scene appears on the map's satellite view.
- **Points of Interest (POIs)**: Submit a [proposal on the DAO](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposals/?type=poi) to have your scene featured as a Point of Interest on the map.
- **Description and thumbnail**: Craft enticing descriptions and eye-catching thumbnails to attract players before they enter your scene. These elements are crucial for making a strong impression when selecting a scene on the map, teleporting from another scene, or encountering a shared link on social media.

- **Events**: Take advantage of the [events page](https://decentraland.org/events/) to promote gatherings, from scene inaugurations to themed seasonal events. Hosting events can draw large crowds, and offering rewards like wearables or emotes can enhance player engagement.
- **Quests**: Incorporate your scene into [Quests]({{< ref "/content/creator/quests/overview.md" >}}) to guide players through various experiences. Creating quests can encourage visits to your scene as part of an engaging journey.
- **Build Traffic**: Attract players by creating a vibrant scene that draws in visitors. Once a critical mass of players is present, others may join in, attracted by the bustling activity.
