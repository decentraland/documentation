## Materials

Materials can be applied to entities that use primitive shapes (cube, sphere, plane, etc) by adding a `Material` component. This component has several fields that allow you to configure the properties of the material, add a texture, etc.

_glTF_ models include their own materials that are implicitly imported into a scene together with the model. To modify or override these materials, use the `GltfNodeModifiers` component. See [Modify glTF materials](#modify-gltf-materials) for more details.

When importing a 3D model with its own materials, keep in mind that not all shaders are supported by the Decentraland engine. Only standard materials and PBR (physically based rendering) materials are supported. See [external 3D model considerations](/creator/3d-modeling/materials) for more details.

There are different types of supported materials:

- PBR (Physically Based Rendering): The most common kind of material in Decentraland. It supports plain colors or textures, and different properties like metallic, emissive, transparency, etc. Read more about [PBR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering).
- Basic materials: They don't respond to lights and shadows, which makes them ideal for displaying billboard images.

## Use the Scene Editor

The easiest way to give an entity a Material is to use the [Scene Editor]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/get-started/about-editor.md" >}}). You can add a **Material** component to your entity and then configure all of the available fields on the Scene Editor UI. See [Add Components]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/build/components.md#add-components" >}}).

## Add a material

The following example creates a PBR material and sets some of its fields to give it a red color and metallic properties. This material is added to an entity that also has a box shape, so it will color the box with this material.

```ts
//Create entity and assign shape
const meshEntity = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(meshEntity, {
	position: Vector3.create(4, 1, 4),
})
MeshRenderer.setBox(meshEntity)

//Create material and configure its fields
Material.setPbrMaterial(meshEntity, {
	albedoColor: Color4.Red(),
	metallic: 0.8,
	roughness: 0.1,
})
```

To change the material of an entity that already has a `Material` component, run `Material.setPbrMaterial()` or any of the other helper functions and it will overwrite the original material. There's no need to remove the original `Material` or to use the advanced syntax.

```ts
//Create entity and assign shape
const meshEntity = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(meshEntity, {
	position: Vector3.create(4, 1, 4),
})
MeshRenderer.setBox(meshEntity)

//Create material and configure its fields
Material.setPbrMaterial(meshEntity, {
	albedoColor: Color4.Red(),
})

//Overwrite with new material component
Material.setPbrMaterial(meshEntity, {
	albedoColor: Color4.Blue(),
})
```

{{< hint warning >}}
**📔 Note**: The `Material` component must be imported via

> `import { Material } from "@dcl/sdk/ecs"`

See [Imports]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/getting-started/coding-scenes.md#imports" >}}) for how to handle these easily.
{{< /hint >}}

## Material colors

Give a material a plain color. In a PBR Material, you set the `albedoColor` field. Albedo colors respond to light and can include shades on them.

Color values are of type `Color4`, composed of _r_, _g_ and _b_ values (red, green, and blue). Each of these takes values between 0 and 1. By setting different values for these, you can compose any visible color. For black, set all three to 0. For white, set all to 1.

{{< hint warning >}}
**📔 Note**: If you set any color in `albedoColor` to a value higher than _1_, it will appear as _emissive_, with more intensity the higher the value. So for example, `{r: 15, g: 0, b: 0}` produces a very bright red glow.
{{< /hint >}}

See [color types]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/color-types.md" >}}) for more details on how to set colors.

You can also edit the following fields in a PBR Material to fine-tune how its color is perceived:

- _emissiveColor_: The color emitted from the material.
- _reflectivityColor_: AKA _Specular Color_ in other nomenclature.

To create a plain color material that is not affected by light and shadows in the environment, create a basic material instead of a PBR material.

```ts
Material.setBasicMaterial(myEntity, {
	diffuseColor: Color4.Black(),
})
```

## Using textures

Set an image file as a texture on a material by setting the `texture` parameter.

```ts
//Create entity and assign shape
const meshEntity = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(meshEntity, {
	position: Vector3.create(4, 1, 4),
})
MeshRenderer.setBox(meshEntity)

//Create material and configure its fields
Material.setPbrMaterial(meshEntity, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'assets/materials/wood.png',
	}),
})
```

In the example above, the image for the material is located in a `assets/materials` folder, which is located at root level of the scene project folder.

{{< hint info >}}
**💡 Tip**: We recommend keeping your texture image files somewhere in the `/assets` folder inside your scene.
{{< /hint >}}

While creating a texture, you can also pass additional parameters:

- `filterMode`: Determines how pixels in the texture are stretched or compressed when rendered. This takes a value from the `TextureFilterMode` enum. See [Texture Scaling](#texture-scaling).
- `wrapMode`: Determines how a texture is tiled onto an object. This takes a value from the `TextureWrapMode` enum. See [Texture Wrapping](#texture-wrapping).

```ts
Material.setPbrMaterial(myEntity, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'assets/materials/wood.png',
		filterMode: TextureFilterMode.TFM_BILINEAR,
		wrapMode: TextureWrapMode.TWM_CLAMP,
	}),
})
```

To create a texture that is not affected by light and shadows in the environment, create a basic material instead of a PBR material.

```ts
Material.setBasicMaterial(myEntity, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'assets/materials/wood.png',
	}),
})
```

### Textures from an external URL

You can point the texture of your material to an external URL instead of an internal path in the scene project.

```ts
Material.setBasicMaterial(myEntity, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'https://wearable-api.decentraland.org/v2/collections/community_contest/wearables/cw_tuxedo_tshirt_upper_body/thumbnail',
	}),
})
```

The URL must start with `https`, `http` URLs aren't supported. The site where the image is hosted should also have [CORS policies (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) that permit externally accessing it.

### Texture wrapping

You can set how a texture aligns with a surface. By default, the texture is stretched to occupy the surface once, but you can scale it, and offset it.

The following fields are available on all textures:

- `offset`: Shifts the texture to change its alignment. The value is a Vector2, where both axis go from 0 to 1, where 1 is the full width or height of the texture.
- `tiling`: Scales the texture. The default value is the Vector 2 `[1, 1]`, which makes the image repeat once covering all of the surface.
- `TextureWrapMode`: Determines what happens if the image tiling doesn't cover all of the surface. This property takes its values from the `TextureWrapMode` enum, which allows for the following values:

  - `TextureWrapMode.TWM_CLAMP`: The texture is only displayed once in the specified size. The rest of the surface of the mesh is left transparent. The value of `tiling` is ignored.
  - `TextureWrapMode.TWM_REPEAT`: The texture is repeated as many times as it fits in the mesh, using the specified size.
  - `TextureWrapMode.TWM_MIRROR`: As in wrap, the texture is repeated as many times as it fits, but the orientation of these repetitions is mirrored.

```ts
Material.setPbrMaterial(myEntity, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'assets/materials/wood.png',
		wrapMode: TextureWrapMode.TWM_REPEAT,
		offset: Vector2.create(0, 0.2),
		tiling: Vector2.create(1, 1),
	}),
})
```

{{< hint warning >}}
**📔 Note**: The `offset` and `tiling` properties are only supported in the DCL 2.0 desktop client.
{{< /hint >}}

Use this feature to cover a large surface with a tiled pattern. For example, repeat the following image:

<img src="/images/editor/tiles.png" width="200" />

```ts
Material.setPbrMaterial(myEntity, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'assets/materials/wood.png',
		wrapMode: TextureWrapMode.TWM_REPEAT,
		tiling: Vector2.create(8, 8),
	}),
})
```

<img src="/images/editor/tiles-in-scene.png" width="500" />

In the example below, the texture uses a _mirror_ wrap mode, and each repetition of the texture takes only 1/4 of the surface. This means that we'll see 4 copies of the image, mirrored against each other on both axis.

```ts
Material.setPbrMaterial(myEntity, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'materials/atlas.png',
		wrapMode: TextureWrapMode.TWM_MIRROR,
		tiling: Vector2.create(0.25, 0.25),
	}),
})
```

### Texture tweens

Make a texture slide smoothly by using a `Tween` component, set up with the `TextureMove` mode. The tween gradually changes the value of the `offset` or the `tiling` properties of a texture over a period of time, in a smooth and optimized way.

{{< hint warning >}}
**📔 Note**: Texture Tweens are a feature that's only supported in the DCL 2.0 desktop client.
{{< /hint >}}

Use the `Tween` component with the `setTextureMove` function to move the texture between two positions.

```ts
Tween.setTextureMove(myEntity, Vector2.create(0, 0), Vector2.create(1, 0), 2000)
```

The texture tween takes the following information:

- `entity`: The entity to move the texture of
- `start`: A Vector2 for the starting position
- `end`: A Vector2 for the ending position
- `duration`: How many milliseconds it takes to move between the two positions

This other optional parameter is also available:

- `movementType`: defines if the movement will be on the `offset` or the `tiling` field. By default it uses `offset`.
- `easingFunction`: The curve for the rate of change over time, the default value is `EasingFunction.EF_LINEAR`. Other values make the change accelerate and/or decelerate at different rates.

```ts
const myEntity = engine.addEntity()

MeshRenderer.setPlane(myEntity)

Transform.create(myEntity, {
	position: Vector3.create(4, 1, 4),
})

Material.setPbrMaterial(myEntity, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'materials/water.png',
		wrapMode: TextureWrapMode.TWM_REPEAT,
	}),
})

Tween.setTextureMove(myEntity, Vector2.create(0, 0), Vector2.create(0, 1), 1000)
```

The above example runs a tween that lasts 1 second, and moves the texture only once. To achieve a continuous movement, for example to simulate the falling of a cascade, you need to use `setTextureMoveContinuous`.

```ts
const myEntity = engine.addEntity()

MeshRenderer.setPlane(myEntity)

Transform.create(myEntity, {
	position: Vector3.create(4, 1, 4),
})

Material.setPbrMaterial(myEntity, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'materials/water.png',
		wrapMode: TextureWrapMode.TWM_REPEAT,
	}),
})

Tween.setTextureMoveContinuous(myEntity, Vector2.create(0, 1), 1)
```

The example above use `setTextureMoveContinuous`, with a direction of `(0, 1)`, and a speed of 1 unit per second.

The texture continuous tween takes the following information:

- `entity`: The entity to move the texture of
- `direction`: A Vector2 for the movement
- `speed`: How many units per second the entity will move

These other optional parameters are also available:

- `movementType`: defines if the movement will be on the offset or the tiling field. By default it uses offset.
- `duration`: How many milliseconds to sustain the movement. After this time, the movement will stop.

#### Complex tween sequences

You can also make the texture movements follow a complex sequence with as many steps as you want. Use the `sequence` field to list as many tweens as you want, they will be executed sequentially after the first tween described on the `Tween` component.

```ts
//(...)
Tween.setTextureMove(myEntity, Vector2.create(0, 0), Vector2.create(0, 1), 1000)

TweenSequence.create(myEntity, {
	sequence: [
		{
			mode: Tween.Mode.TextureMove({
				start: Vector2.create(0, 1),
				end: Vector2.create(1, 1),
			}),
			duration: 1000,
			easingFunction: EasingFunction.EF_LINEAR,
		},
		{
			mode: Tween.Mode.TextureMove({
				start: Vector2.create(1, 1),
				end: Vector2.create(1, 0),
			}),
			duration: 1000,
			easingFunction: EasingFunction.EF_LINEAR,
		},
		{
			mode: Tween.Mode.TextureMove({
				start: Vector2.create(1, 0),
				end: Vector2.create(0, 0),
			}),
			duration: 1000,
			easingFunction: EasingFunction.EF_LINEAR,
		},
	],
	loop: TweenLoop.TL_RESTART,
})
```

Note that when defining a tween within a TweenSequence, you need to use the more verbose format of `Tween.Mode.TextureMove` to define the tween.

### Multi-layered textures

You can use several image files as layers to compose more realistic textures, for example including a `bumpTexture` and a `emissiveTexture`.

```ts
Material.setPbrMaterial(myEntity, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'materials/wood.png',
	}),
	bumpTexture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'materials/woodBump.png',
	}),
	emissiveTexture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'materials/glow.png',
	}),
})
```

The `bumpTexture` can simulate bumps and wrinkles on a surface, by modifying how the normals of the surface behave on each pixel.

<img src="/images/editor/wood-bump.png" width="500" />

The `emissiveTexture` can accentuate glow on certain parts of a material, to achieve very interesting effects.

#### Set UVs

Another alternative for changing a texture's scale or alignment is to configure _uv_ properties on the [MeshRenderer component]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/shape-components.md" >}}).

You set _u_ and _v_ coordinates on the 2D image of the texture to correspond to the vertices of the shape. The more vertices the entity has, the more _uv_ coordinates need to be defined on the texture, a plane for example needs to have 8 _uv_ points defined, 4 for each of its two faces.

```ts
const meshEntity = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(meshEntity, {
	position: Vector3.create(4, 1, 4),
})
MeshRenderer.setPlane(
	meshEntity,
	[
		0, 0.75,

		0.25, 0.75,

		0.25, 1,

		0, 1,

		0, 0.75,

		0.25, 0.75,

		0.25, 1,

		0, 1,
	]
)

Material.setPbrMaterial(myEntity, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'materials/wood.png',
		wrapMode: TextureWrapMode.TWM_REPEAT,
	}),
})
```

The following example includes a function that simplifies the setting of uvs. The `setUVs` function defined here receives a number of rows and columns as parameters, and sets the uvs so that the texture image is repeated a specific number of times.

```ts
const meshEntity = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(meshEntity, {
	position: Vector3.create(4, 1, 4),
})
MeshRenderer.setBox(meshEntity, setUVs(3, 3))

Material.setPbrMaterial(myEntity, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'materials/atlas.png',
		wrapMode: TextureWrapMode.TWM_REPEAT,
	}),
})

function setUVs(rows: number, cols: number) {
	return [
		// North side of unrortated plane
		0, //lower-left corner
		0,

		cols, //lower-right corner
		0,

		cols, //upper-right corner
		rows,

		0, //upper left-corner
		rows,

		// South side of unrortated plane
		cols, // lower-right corner
		0,

		0, // lower-left corner
		0,

		0, // upper-left corner
		rows,

		cols, // upper-right corner
		rows,
	]
}
```

For setting the UVs for a `box` mesh shape, the same structure applies. Each of the 6 faces of the cube takes 4 pairs of coordinates, one for each corner. All of these 48 values are listed as a single array.

{{< hint warning >}}
**📔 Note**: Uv properties are currently only available on `plane` and on `box` shapes. Also, _uv_ values affect all the texture layers equally, since they are set on the _shape_.
{{< /hint >}}

### Texture scaling

When textures are stretched or shrinked to a different size from the original texture image, this can sometimes create artifacts. In a 3D environment, the effects of perspective cause this naturally. There are various [texture filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_filtering) algorithms that exist to compensate for this in different ways.

The `Material` object uses the _bilinear_ algorithm by default, but it lets you configure it to use the _nearest neighbor_ or _trilinear_ algorithms instead by setting the `samplingMode` property of the texture. This takes a value from the `TextureFilterMode` enum:

- `TextureFilterMode.TFM_POINT`: Uses a "nearest neighbor" algorithm. This setting is ideal for pixel art style graphics, as the contours will remain sharply marked as the texture is seen larger on screen instead of being blurred.
- `TextureFilterMode.TFM_BILINEAR`: Uses a bilinear algorithm to estimate the color of each pixel.
- `TextureFilterMode.TFM_TRILINEAR`: Uses a trilinear algorithm to estimate the color of each pixel.

```ts
Material.setPbrMaterial(myEntity, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'materials/atlas.png',
		filterMode: TextureFilterMode.TFM_BILINEAR,
	}),
})
```

## Unlit Materials

Most of the times you'll want the materials in your scene to be affected by the lighting conditions, including shadows and being tinted by the hue changes of different times of day. But in other cases you might want to show the colors in their pure state. This is useful when playing videos, or also for abstract markers that need to stand out, that are meant for signalling hints to the player.

To create an unlit material, use `Material.setBasicMaterial`. Basic materials don't have all the same properties as PBR materials, they only have the essential:

- `diffuseColor`: Color4 for the color
- `texture`: Texture
- `alphaTexture`: Separate texture for the transparency layer
- `alphaTest`: Threshold for achieving transparency based on the color of the texture
- `castShadows`: If false, no shadows are projected onto other entities in the scene.

```ts
Material.setBasicMaterial(screen, {
	diffuseColor: Color4.Red(),
})
```

## Avatar Portraits

To display a thumbnail image of any player, use `Material.Texture.Avatar` when setting the texture of your material, passing the address of an existing player. This creates a texture from a 256x256 image of the player, showing head and shoulders. The player is displayed wearing the set of wearables that the current server last recorded.

```ts
Material.setPbrMaterial(myEntity, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Avatar({
		userId: '0x517....',
	}),
})
```

![](/images/avatarTexture.png)

You can fetch the portrait of any Decentraland player, even if they're not currently connected, and even if they don't have a claimed Decentraland name.

The following properties are supported within the object you pass as an argument:

- `userId`: ID of the user who's profile you want to display
- `filterMode`: Determines how pixels in the texture are stretched or compressed when rendered. This takes a value from the `TextureFilterMode` enum. See [Texture Scaling](#texture-scaling).
- `wrapMode`: Determines how a texture is tiled onto an object. This takes a value from the `TextureWrapMode` enum. See [Texture Wrapping](#texture-wrapping).

## Transparent materials

To make a material with a plain color transparent, simply define the color as a `Color4`, and set the 4th value to something between _0_ and _1_. The closer to _1_, the more opaque it will be.

```typescript
let transparentRed = Color4.create(1, 0, 0, 0.5)

Material.setPbrMaterial(meshEntity, {
	albedoColor: transparentRed,
})
```

If a material uses a .png texture that includes transparency, it will be opaque by default, but you can activate its transparency by setting the `transparencyMode` to `MaterialTransparencyMode.MTM_ALPHA_BLEND`.

<img src="/images/editor/transparent-image.png" width="500" />

```typescript
Material.setPbrMaterial(floor, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'assets/scene/transparent-image.png',
	}),
	transparencyMode: MaterialTransparencyMode.MTM_ALPHA_BLEND,
})
```

The `transparencyMode` can have the following values:

- `MaterialTransparencyMode.MTM_OPAQUE`: No transparency at all
- `MaterialTransparencyMode.MTM_ALPHA_TEST`: Each pixel is either completely opaque or completely transparent, based on a threshold.
- `MaterialTransparencyMode.MTM_ALPHA_BLEND`: Intermediate values are possible based on the value of each pixel.
- `MaterialTransparencyMode.MTM_ALPHA_TEST_AND_ALPHA_BLEND`: Uses a combination of both methods.
- `MaterialTransparencyMode.MTM_AUTO`: Determines the method based on the provided texture.

<!-- TODO: Confirm that auto really works like that!! -->

If you set the `transparencyMode` to `MaterialTransparencyMode.MTM_ALPHA_TEST`, you can fine tune the threshold used to determine if each pixel is transparent or not. Set the `alphaTest` property between _0_ and _1_. By default its value is _0.5_.

```ts
// Using alpha test
Material.setPbrMaterial(meshEntity1, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'images/myTexture.png',
	}),
	transparencyMode: MaterialTransparencyMode.MTM_ALPHA_TEST,
	alphaTest: 1,
})
```

When using an [unlit material](#unlit-materials), you can add an `alphaTexture` to make only certain regions of the material transparent, based on a texture.

{{< hint warning >}}
**📔 Note**: This must be a single-channel image. In this image use the color red or black to determine what parts of the real texture should be transparent.
{{< /hint >}}

<img src="/images/circular-video-screen.png" width="500" />

```ts
// Using alpha test
Material.setPbrMaterial(meshEntity1, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'images/myTexture.png',
	}),
	alphaTexture: Material.Texture.Common({
		src: 'assets/scene/circle_mask.png',
		wrapMode: TextureWrapMode.TWM_MIRROR,
	}),
})
```

This can be used in very interesting ways together with videos. See [video playing]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/media/video-playing.md" >}}).

<!--
## Casting no shadows

 TODO: not currently working


To prevent a material from casting shadows over other objects, use the `castShadows` property set to _false_. This property is always _true_ by default.

```ts
Material.create(meshEntity3, {
  albedoColor: Color4.Red(),
  castShadows: true
})
```
-->

## Video playing

To stream video from a URL into a material, or play a video from a file stored in the scene, see [video playing]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/media/video-playing.md" >}}).

The video is used as a texture on a material, you can set any of the other properties of materials to alter how the video screen looks.

## Advanced syntax

The complete syntax for creating a `Materials` component, without any helpers to simplify it, looks like this:

```ts
Material.create(myEntity, {
	texture: {
		tex: {
			$case: 'texture',
			texture: {
				src: 'images/scene-thumbnail.png',
			},
		},
	},
})

Material.create(myEntity, {
	texture: {
		tex: {
			$case: 'avatarTexture',
			avatarTexture: {
				userId: '0x517....',
			},
		},
	},
})
```

This is how the base protocol interprets Materials components. The helper functions abstract away from this and expose a friendlier syntax, but behind the scenes they output this syntax.

The `$case` field allows you to specify one of the allowed types. Each type supports a different set of parameters. In the example above, the `box` type supports a `uvs` field.

The supported values for `$case` are the following:

- `texture`
- `avatarTexture`

Depending on the value of `$case`, it's valid to define the object for the corresponding shape, passing any relevant properties.

To add a `Material` component to an entity that potentially already has an instance of this component, use `Material.createOrReplace()`. The helper functions like `MeshRenderer.setPbrMaterial()` handle overwriting existing instances of the component, but running `Material.create()` on an entity that already has this component returns an error.

## Modify glTF materials

Use the `GltfNodeModifiers` component to modify the materials of a _glTF_ model. This component allows you to override the materials of a _glTF_ model with your own materials. You can use any of the properties of the `Material` component, including texture, video texture, unlit materials, etc.

There are two ways to use the `GltfNodeModifiers` component:

- Modify the material of the entire model by leaving the `path` property as an empty string.
- Modify the material of a specific node in the model (or several nodes) by setting the `path` property to the path to the node.

### Modify the material of the entire model

The following example shows how to modify the material of a _glTF_ model. In this case, the material of the entire model is modified to be red.

```ts
import { GltfNodeModifiers, GltfContainer, Transform } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

const myEntity = engine.addEntity()

GltfContainer.create(myEntity, {
	src: 'models/myModel.glb',
})

Transform.create(myEntity, {
	position: Vector3.create(4, 0, 4),
})

GltfNodeModifiers.create(myEntity, {
	modifiers: [
		{
			path: '',
			material: {
				material: {
					$case: 'pbr',
					pbr: {
						albedoColor: Color4.Red(),
					},
				},
			},
		},
	],
})
```

The `GltfNodeModifiers` component has the following properties:

- `modifiers`: An array of modifiers. Each modifier has the following properties:
  - `path`: The path to the node in the model to modify.
  - `material`: The material to use.

The `path` property is a string that represents the path to the node in the _glTF_ model to modify. If you want to modify the material of the entire model, you can use an empty string. If you want to modify the material of a specific node, you can use the path to the node. The path must point to a mesh node, not a vertex node.

{{< hint info >}}
**💡 Tip**: You can use the [Babylon Sandbox app](https://sandbox.babylonjs.com/) to inspect the _glTF_ model and find the path to the node you want to modify.

In some models, however, the Babylon sandbox may list paths that belong to vertexes rather than meshes, which will not work. If you attempt to use a path that isn't valid, the scene's console will display an error message that includes the full list of valid paths on that model.
{{< /hint >}}

The `material` property is an object that represents the material to use. It needs to be written using the [advanced syntax](#advanced-syntax) for materials, as shown in the example above. Helper functions like `Material.setPbrMaterial()` can't be used here.

### Modify the material of a specific node in the model

The following example shows how to modify the material of a specific node in the _glTF_ model. In this case, the material of the head is modified to use an alternative texture.

```ts
import { GltfNodeModifiers, GltfContainer, Transform } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

const myEntity = engine.addEntity()

GltfContainer.create(myEntity, {
	src: 'models/myModel.glb',
})

Transform.create(myEntity, {
	position: Vector3.create(4, 0, 4),
})

GltfNodeModifiers.create(myEntity, {
	modifiers: [
		{
			path: 'M_Head_BaseMesh',
			material: {
				material: {
					$case: 'pbr',
					pbr: {
						texture: Material.Texture.Common({
							src: 'assets/scene/images/blinking-head.png',
						}),
					},
				},
			},
		},
	],
})
```

A `GltfNodeModifiers` can contain several modifiers, each modifying a different node in the model. The following example shows how to modify the material of the head and the body of a _glTF_ model.

```ts
import { GltfNodeModifiers, GltfContainer, Transform } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

const myEntity = engine.addEntity()

GltfContainer.create(myEntity, {
	src: 'models/myModel.glb',
})

Transform.create(myEntity, {
	position: Vector3.create(4, 0, 4),
})

GltfNodeModifiers.create(myEntity, {
	modifiers: [
		{
			path: 'M_Head_BaseMesh',
			material: {
				material: {
					$case: 'pbr',
					pbr: {
						albedoColor: Color4.Red(),
					},
				},
			},
		},
		{
			path: 'M_Body_BaseMesh',
			material: {
				material: {
					$case: 'pbr',
					pbr: {
						albedoColor: Color4.Blue(),
					},
				},
			},
		},
	],
})
```

### Remove shadows from a glTF model

To remove shadows from a _glTF_ model, you can set the `castShadows` property to `false` in the `GltfNodeModifiers` object. This retains the original material of the model, but prevents it from casting shadows. This is useful for models that are not meant to cast shadows, such as light beams.

```ts
import { GltfNodeModifiers } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

GltfNodeModifiers.create(myEntity, {
	modifiers: [
		{
			path: '',
			castShadows: false,
		},
	],
})
```
