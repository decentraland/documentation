Entities that have colliders occupy space and block a player's path, entities without colliders can be walked through by a player`s avatar. 

Colliders are also needed to make an entity clickable. Button events are based on the collider shape of an entity, not on its visible shape. 

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**:  Colliders don't affect how other entities interact with each other, entities can always overlap. Collision settings only affect how the entity interacts with the player's avatar and button events. Decentraland doesn't have a native physics engine, so if you want entities to fall, crash or bounce, you must code this behavior into the scene, or import a library to handle that.

## Colliders on primitive shapes

Entities that have a `MeshRenderer` component to give them a [primitive shape]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/shape-components.md#primitive-shapes" >}})(boxes, spheres, planes etc) don't have colliders by default. You must also give the entity a `MeshCollider` component.


The following collider shapes are available. Several shapes include optional additional fields, specific to that shape.

- **box**:

	Use `MeshRenderer.setBox()`, passing the entity.

- **plane**:

	Use `MeshRenderer.setPlane()`, passing the entity.

- **sphere**:

	Use `MeshRenderer.setSphere()`, passing the entity. 

- **cylinder**:

	Use `MeshRenderer.setCylinder()`, passing the entity. Pass `radiusTop` and `radiusBottom` as additional optional fields, to modify the cylinder.

	TIP: Set  either `radiusTop` or `radiusBottom` to 0 to make a cone.


This example defines a box entity that can't be walked through.

```ts
// create entity
const myCollider = engine.addEntity()

// visible shape
MeshRenderer.setBox(myCollider)

// collider
MeshCollider.setBox(myCollider)
```

The shape used by the `MeshCollider` doesn't need to necessarily match the one used by the `MeshRenderer`. You can also add a `MeshCollider` to an entity that has a 3D model from a `GLTFContainer` component, or to an entity that has no visible shape at all.

## Colliders on 3D models

3D models can include their own colliders as part of a _.glTF_ or _.glb_ file. Any mesh in the model who's name ends in `_collider` is interpreted as a collider.

A _collider_ is a set of geometric shapes or planes that define which parts of the model are collided with. This allows for much greater control and is a lot less demanding on the system than using the visible geometry, as the collision object is usually a lot simpler (with less vertices) than the original model.

If a model doesn't have collisions, you can either:

- Give the entity a `MeshCollider` component, to give it a primitive shape collider.
- Overlay an invisible entity that has a `MeshCollider` component.
- Edit the model in an external tool like Blender to include a _collider mesh_. The collider must be named _x_collider_, where _x_ is the name of the model. So for a model named _house_, the collider must be named _house_collider_.


See [3D models](/creator/3d-modeling/3d-models) for more details on how to add colliders to a 3D model.

**ðŸ“” Note**:  Colliders on 3D models use the default collision layers, so they affect both player physics and pointer events. It's currently not possible to assign a custom collision layer to a mesh in an imported 3D model.

## Collision layers

The scene can handle separate collision layers, that have different behaviors.

You can configure a `MeshCollider` component to only respond to one kind of interaction, or to severa lof them. To do this, set the `collisionMask` property to one of the following values:

- `ColliderLayer.CL_PHYSICS`: Only blocks player movement (and doesn't affect pointer events)
- `ColliderLayer.CL_POINTER`: Responds only to pointer events (and doesn't block the player movement)
- `ColliderLayer.CL_CUSTOM1` through to `CL_CUSTOM8`: Can be used together with raycasts, so that a ray only detects collisions with one specific layer.

```ts
// create entity
const myEntity = engine.addEntity()
// visible shape
MeshRenderer.setBox(myEntity)

// create a MeshCollider component that only responds to player physics
MeshCollider.setBox(myEntity, ColliderLayer.CL_PHYSICS)
```

A single MeshCollider component can respond to multiple collision layers. Use the `|` character as an _or_, to include as many layers as you need. The default value on a MeshCollider is `ColliderLayer.CL_PHYSICS | ColliderLayer.CL_POINTER`.

```ts
MeshCollider.setBox(myEntity, ColliderLayer.CL_CUSTOM1 | ColliderLayer.CL_CUSTOM3 | ColliderLayer.CL_PHYSICS | ColliderLayer.CL_POINTER )
```

You can use the 8 different custom layers for whatever suits your scene best, for example one could be used for NPC line-of-sight calculations, whilst another for estimating trajectories of falling objects. Using different layers for different systems allows you to use less resources, as in each case you'll only be checking collisions with the relevant entities.

See [Raycasting]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/interactivity/raycasting.md" >}}) for more on how to use custom collision layers.


### Pointer blocking

Only shapes that have colliders can be activated with [pointer events]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/interactivity/button-events/click-events.md" >}}). An entity also needs to have a collider to block pointer events from going through it and hit entities behind it. So for example, a player can't pick something up that is locked inside a chest, if the chest has colliders around it. The player's pointer events are only affected by collider meshes, not by the model's visible geometry.

For colliders to affect pointer events, they must be on the `ColliderLayer.CL_POINTER` layer. By default, a MeshCollider affects both the Physics and the Pointer layers, but you can change this value to only affect one, or neither, and to affect custom layers instead.

```ts
// only responds to player physics
// for example for an invisible wall that you can't walk through but you can click through
MeshCollider.setBox(myEntity, ColliderLayer.CL_PHYSICS)

// only responds to the player's pointer
// for example for example for an item you can click to pick up, but can walk right through
MeshCollider.setBox(myEntity2, ColliderLayer.CL_POINTER)
```


## Advanced Syntax


The complete syntax for creating a `MeshCollider` component, without any helpers to simplify it, looks like this:

```ts
MeshCollider.create(myBox, {
    mesh: { 
      $case: 'box',
      box: {} 
    }
  })

MeshCollider.create(myPlane, {
    mesh: { 
      $case: 'plane',
      plane: {} 
    }
  })

MeshCollider.create(myShpere, {
    mesh: { 
      $case: 'sphere',
      sphere: {} 
    }
  })

MeshCollider.create(myCylinder, {
    mesh: { 
      $case: 'cylinder',
      cylinder: {} 
    }
  })
```

This is how the base protocol interprets MeshCollider components. The helper functions abstract away from this and expose a friendlier syntax, but behind the scenes they output this syntax.

The `$case` field allows you to specify one of the allowed types. Each type supports a different set of parameters.

The supported values for `$case` are the following:

- `box`
- `plane`
- `sphere`
- `cylinder`

Depending on the value of `$case`, it's valid to define the object for the corresponding shape, passing any relevant properties.
