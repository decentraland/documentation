Three dimensional scenes in Decentraland are based on the [Entity-Component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system) model, where everything in a scene is an _entity_, and each entity can include _components_ that shape its characteristics and functionality.

The rendered shape of an entity is determined by what component it uses.

## Primitive shapes

Several basic shapes, often called _primitives_, can be added to an entity by giving the entity a `MeshRenderer` component.

The following shapes are available. Several shapes include optional additional fields, specific to that shape.

- **box**:

	Use `MeshRenderer.setBox()`, passing the entity. Pass `uvs` as an additional optional field, to map texture alignment. See [materials]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/materials.md" >}}) for more details.

- **plane**:

	Use `MeshRenderer.setPlane()`, passing the entity. Pass `uvs` as an additional optional field, to map texture alignment. See [materials]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/materials.md" >}}) for more details.

- **sphere**:

	Use `MeshRenderer.setSphere()`, passing the entity. 

- **cylinder**:

	Use `MeshRenderer.setCylinder()`, passing the entity. Pass `radiusTop` and `radiusBottom` as additional optional fields, to modify the cylinder.

	TIP: Set  either `radiusTop` or `radiusBottom` to 0 to make a cone.

The following example creates a cube:

```ts
const myCube = engine.addEntity()

Transform.create(myCube, {
	position: Vector3.create(8, 1, 8)
})

MeshRenderer.setBox(myCube)
```

The following example creates a cylinder with a `radiusTop` of 0, which produces a cone:

```ts
const myCone = engine.addEntity()

Transform.create(myCone, {
	position: Vector3.create(8, 1, 8)
})

MeshRenderer.setCylinder(myCone, 0, 1)
```

Primitive shapes don't include materials. To give it a color or a texture, you must assign a [material component]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/materials.md" >}}) to the same entity.

To make a primitive clickable, or to prevent players from walking through it, you must give the entity a _collider_ via a [MeshCollider]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/colliders.md" >}}) component.

To change the shape of an entity that already has a `MeshRenderer` component, run `MeshRenderer.setBox()` or any of the other helper functions and it will overwrite the original shape. There's no need to remove the original `MeshRenderer` or to use the advanced syntax.

```ts
const myCube = engine.addEntity()

Transform.create(myCube, {
	position: Vector3.create(8, 1, 8)
})

MeshRenderer.setBox(myCube)

// overwrite shape
MeshRenderer.setSphere(myCube)
```

## 3D models

For more complex shapes, you can build a 3D model in an external tool like Blender and then import them in _.glTF_ or _.glb_ (binary _.glTF_). [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf) (GL Transmission Format) is an open project by Khronos providing a common, extensible format for 3D assets that is both efficient and highly interoperable with modern web technologies.

To add an external model into a scene, add a `GltfContainer` component to an entity and set its `src` to the path of the glTF file containing the model.

```ts
const houseEntity = engine.addEntity()

GltfContainer.create(houseEntity, { 
	src: "models/House.gltf" 
})
```

The `src` field is required, you must give it a value when constructing the component. In the example above, the model is located in a `models` folder at root level of the scene project folder.

**ðŸ’¡ Tip**:  We recommend keeping your models separate in a `/models` folder inside your scene.

glTF models can include their own embedded textures, materials, colliders and animations. See [3D models](/creator/3d-modeling/3d-models) for more information on this.

Keep in mind that all models, their shaders and their textures must be within the parameters of the [scene limitations]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/optimizing/scene-limitations.md" >}}).

### Free libraries for 3D models

Instead of building your own 3D models, you can also download them from several free or paid libraries.

To get you started, below is a list of libraries that have free or relatively inexpensive content:

- [Assets from the Builder](https://github.com/decentraland/builder-assets/tree/master/assets)
- [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/)
- [Clara.io](https://clara.io/)
- [Archive3D](https://archive3d.net/)
- [SketchUp 3D Warehouse](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/)
- [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) (3D models made primarily for 3D printing, but adaptable to Virtual Worlds)
- [ShareCG](https://www.sharecg.com/)
- [CGTrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/)

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**:  Pay attention to the license restrictions that the content you download has.
{{< /hint >}}

Note that in several of these sites, you can choose what format to download the model in. Always choose _.glTF_ format if available. If not available, you must convert them to _glTF_ before you can use them in a scene. For that, we recommend importing them into Blender and exporting as _.glTF_ from there.


### Optimize 3D models

To ensure that 3D models in your scene load faster and take up less memory, follow these best practices:

- Save your models in _.glb_ format, which is a lighter version of _.gltf_.
- If you have multiple models that share the same textures, export your models with textures in a separate file. That way multiple models can refer to a single texture file that only needs to be loaded once.
- If your scene has entities that appear and disappear, it might be a good idea to pool these entities and keep them underground, or at a scale of 0. This will help them appear faster, the trade-off is that they will occupy memory when not in use. See [entities and components]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/architecture/entities-components.md#pooling-entities-and-components" >}})


## Stretching a shape

Primitive shapes and 3D models have default dimensions that you can alter by changing the scale in the entity's `Transform` component.

```ts
const primitiveEntity = engine.addEntity()

MeshRenderer.setBox(primitiveEntity)

Transform.ceate(primitiveEntity, {
	position: {x: 8, y:1, z: 8},
	scale: {x: 4, y:0.5, z: 4}
})
```

## Make invisible


You can make an entity invisible by giving an entity a `VisibilityComponent`, with its `visible` property set to _false_.


```ts
const myEntity = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(myEntity, { 
  position: Vector3.create(4, 0, 4)
})
MeshRenderer.setBox(myEntity)

VisibilityComponent.create(myEntity, {visible: false})
```

The `VisibilityComponent` works the same for entities with primitive shapes and with `GLTFContainer` components.

If an entity is invisible, its collider can block a player's path and can prevent clicking entities that are behind it.


## Advanced syntax

The complete syntax for creating a `MeshRenderer` component, without any helpers to simplify it, looks like this:

```ts
MeshRenderer.setBox(myBox, {
    mesh: { 
      $case: 'box',
      box: { uvs: []} 
    }
  })

MeshRenderer.create(myPlane, {
    mesh: { 
      $case: 'plane',
      plane: { uvs: []} 
    }
  })

MeshRenderer.create(myShpere, {
    mesh: { 
      $case: 'sphere',
      sphere: {} 
    }
  })

MeshRenderer.create(myCylinder, {
    mesh: { 
      $case: 'cylinder',
      cylinder: {} 
    }
  })
```

This is how the base protocol interprets MeshRenderer components. The helper functions abstract away from this and expose a friendlier syntax, but behind the scenes they output this syntax.


The `$case` field allows you to specify one of the allowed types. Each type supports a different set of parameters. In the example above, the `box` type supports a `uvs` field.

The supported values for `$case` are the following:

- `box`
- `plane`
- `sphere`
- `cylinder`

Depending on the value of `$case`, it's valid to define the object for the corresponding shape, passing any relevant properties.

To add a `MeshRenderer` component to an entity that potentially already has an instance of this component, use `MeshRenderer.createOrReplace()`. The helper functions like `MeshRenderer.setBox()` handle overwriting existing instances of the component, but running `MeshRenderer.create()` on an entity that already has this component returns an error.
