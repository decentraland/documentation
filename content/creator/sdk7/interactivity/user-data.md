## Player position and rotation

Use the `PlayerEntity` and the `CameraEntity` to know the player's position and rotation, by checking their `Transform` components.

```ts
function getPlayerPosition() {
	if (!Transform.has(engine.PlayerEntity)) return
	if (!Transform.has(engine.CameraEntity)) return

	//player position
	const playerPos = Transform.get(engine.PlayerEntity).position

	//player rotation
	const playerRot = Transform.get(engine.PlayerEntity).rotation

	//camera position
	const CameraPos = Transform.get(engine.CameraEntity).position

	//camera rotation
	const CameraRot = Transform.get(engine.CameraEntity).rotation

	console.log('playerPos: ', playerPos)
	console.log('playerRot: ', playerRot)
	console.log('cameraPos: ', CameraPos)
	console.log('cameraRot: ', CameraRot)
}

engine.addSystem(getPlayerPosition)
```

- **PlayerEntity position**: The avatar's position, at chest height. Approximately at 0.88 cm above the ground.
- **PlayerEntity rotation**: The direction in which the avatar is facing, expressed as a quaternion.
- **CameraEntity position**:
  - In 1st person: Equal to the avatar's position, but at eye-level. Approximately at 1.75 cm above the ground.
  - In 3rd person: May vary depending on camera movements.
- **PlayerEntity rotation**:
  - In 1st person: Similar to the direction in which the avatar is facing, expressed as a quaternion. May be rounded slightly differently from the player's rotation.
  - In 3rd person: May vary depending on camera movements.

```ts
const cube = engine.addEntity()

Transform.create(cube, {
	position: Vector3.create(3, 1, 3),
})

MeshRenderer.setBox(cube)

function CubeRotateSystem() {
	if (!Transform.has(engine.PlayerEntity)) return
	const transform = Transform.getMutable(cube)
	transform.rotation = Transform.get(engine.PlayerEntity).rotation
}

engine.addSystem(CubeRotateSystem)
```

The example above uses the player's rotation to set that of a cube in the scene.

**üìî Note**: Avoid referring to the `engine.PlayerEntity` or the `engine.CameraEntity` on the initial scene loading, because that can result in errors if the entities are not initialized yet. To avoid this problem, encapsulate the behavior in an async [`executeTask` block]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/programming-patterns/async-functions.md#the-executetask-function" >}}).

If you refer to these entities in a system, they will always be available, because the first execution of the system is called once the scene is already properly initialized.
{{< /hint >}}

### Positions from all players

All players in the scene have a `Transform` component. This component is read only in avatars. To fetch the positions of all players, [iterate over all entities with]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/architecture/querying-components.md#" >}}) a `PlayerIdentityData` component.

```ts
for (const [entity, data, transform] of engine.getEntitiesWith(
	PlayerIdentityData,
	Transform
)) {
	console.log('Player data: ', { entity, data, transform })
}
```

The code above iterates over all entities with a `Transform` and a `PlayerIdentityData` component, and logs their data.

## Get player data

Use `players.getPlayerData()` to fetch data about the current player, or any other player in the scene.

TODO: Snippet

`players.getPlayerData()` returns the following:

- `name`: _(string)_ The player's user name, as others see in-world
- `userId`: _(string)_ A UUID string that identifies the player. If the player has a public key, this field will have the same value as the public key.
- `isGuest`: _(boolean)_ Indicates if the player has a public key. _True_ if the player is a guest account without a public key.
- `avatar`: A nested object with data about the player's base avatar and appearance.
- `wearables`: A nested object with data about the player's equipped wearables and emotes.

The `avatar` object has the following nested information:

- `bodyShape`:

- `name`: The player's name.
- `bodyShapeUrn`: An identifier for the avatar's general body shape. Either `urn:decentraland:off-chain:base-avatars:BaseFemale` for female or `urn:decentraland:off-chain:base-avatars:BaseMale` for male.
- `skinColor`: Player skin color as a `Color4`
- `eyeColor`: Player eye color as a `Color4`
- `hairColor`: Player hair color as a `Color4`

The `wearables` object has the following information

- `wearables`: `WearableId[]` An array of identifiers for each of the wearables that the player is currently wearing. For example `urn:decentraland:off-chain:base-avatars:green_hoodie`. All wearables have a similar identifier, even if they're NFTs.
- `wearable_urns`: An array of identifiers for each of the wearables that the player is currently wearing. For example `urn:decentraland:off-chain:base-avatars:green_hoodie`. All wearables have a similar identifier, even if they're NFTs.
- `emotes_urns`: An array of identifiers for each of the emotes that the player currently has equipped in the quick access wheel.

TODO: Snippet

{{< hint warning >}}
**üìî Note**: The `players.getPlayerData()` function is asynchronous. See [Asynchronous functions]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/programming-patterns/async-functions.md" >}}) if you're not familiar with those.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint info >}}
**üí° Tip**: When testing in preview, to avoid using a random avatar, run the scene in the browser connected with your Metamask wallet. In the Decentraland Editor, open the Decentraland tab and hover your mouse over it to display the three dots icon on the top-right. Click this icon and select **Open in browser with Web3**.
{{< /hint >}}

To get the data for a specific player in the scene, different from the current player, run `players.getPlayerData()` with an object with a `userId` property.

TODO: Snippet

TODO: How to get IDs from other players

players.onEnterScene
players.onLeaveScene

You can obtain the current player's id from `myProfile.userId`:

```ts
import { myProfile } from '@dcl/sdk/network'

export function main() {
	console.log('UserId: ', myProfile.userId)
}
```

`players.getPlayerData()` can only fetch data from players who are currently standing in the same scene, they don't have to necessarily be in visual range, but they should be connected to the same comms island. To try this out in preview, open a second tab and log in with a different account, and have both players stand inside the scene.

TODO: CHECK THIS:
{{< hint warning >}}
**üìî Note**: User IDs must always be lowercase. If copying a wallet address, make sure all the characters are set to lowercase.
{{< /hint >}}

## Data from any player

To obtain information from any player, make a [REST API call]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/networking/network-connections.md#call-a-rest-api">}}) to the content servers.

This information is exposed in the following URL, appending the player's user id to the url parameter.

`https://peer.decentraland.org/lambdas/profile/<player user id>`

{{< hint info >}}
**üí° Tip**: Try the URL out in a browser to see how the response is structured.
{{< /hint >}}

The following information is available from this API:

- `displayName`: _(string)_ The player's user name, as others see in-world
- `userId`: _(string)_ A UUID string that identifies the player. If the player has a public key, this field will have the same value as the public key.
- `hasConnectedWeb3`: _(boolean)_ Indicates if the player has a public key. _True_ if the player has one.
- `publicKey`: _(string)_ The public key of the player's Ethereum wallet. If the player logs in as a guest, with no linked wallet, this field will be `null`.
- `avatar`: A nested object with data about the player's appearance.
- `version`: _(number)_ A version number that increases by one every time the player changes any of their settings. Use this if you encounter conflicting data, to know what version is more recent.

{{< hint warning >}}
**üìî Note**: For any Ethereum transactions with the player, always use the `publicKey` field, instead of the `userId`, to avoid dealing with non-existing wallets.
{{< /hint >}}

The `avatar` object has the following nested information:

- `wearables`: `WearableId[]` An array of identifiers for each of the wearables that the player is currently wearing. For example `urn:decentraland:off-chain:base-avatars:green_hoodie`. All wearables have a similar identifier, even if they're NFTs.
- `bodyShape`: An identifier for the avatar's general body shape. Either `urn:decentraland:off-chain:base-avatars:BaseFemale` for female or `urn:decentraland:off-chain:base-avatars:BaseMale` for male.

- `skinColor`: _ColorString_ A hex value for the player's skin color.
- `hairColor`: _ColorString_ A hex value for the player's hair color.
- `eyeColor`: _ColorString_ A hex value for the player's eye color.
- `snapshots`: A nested object with base64 representations of .jpg images of the player in various resolutions.
  - `face256`: _string_ The player's face as a 256x256 pixel image.
  - `body`: _string_ The full resolution image of the player standing straight, with 512x1024 pixels.

{{< hint danger >}}
**‚ùóWarning**
The snapshots of the avatar will be deprecated in the future and will no longer be returned as part of an avatar's data. The recommended approach is to use `AvatarTexture` instead, see [Avatar Portraits]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/materials.md#avatar-portraits">}}).
{{< /hint >}}

Unlike `players.getPlayerData()`, this option is not limited to just the players who are currently in the same scene, or even in the same server. With this approach you can fetch data from any player that has logged onto the servers in the past.

If you know which server the player you want to query is connected to, you can get more up-to-date data by sending your requests to that specific server. For example, if the player changes clothes, this information will be available instantly in the player's server, but will likely take a couple of minutes to propagate to the `peer.decentraland.org` server.

`https://<player server>/lambdas/profile/<player user id>`

{{< hint info >}}
**üí° Tip**: You can obtain the current player's server by fetching `getRealm().domain`.
{{< /hint >}}

This example combines `myProfile.userId` and `getRealm()` to obtain the player's data directly from the server that the player is on:

```ts
import { getUserData } from '~system/UserIdentity'
import { getRealm } from '~system/Runtime'
import { myProfile } from '@dcl/sdk/network'

async function fetchPlayerData() {
	const { realmInfo } = await getRealm({})

	const url = `${realmInfo.baseUrl}/lambdas/profile/${myProfile.userId}`
	console.log('using URL: ', url)

	try {
		const json = (await fetch(url)).json()

		console.log('full response: ', json)
		console.log(
			'player is wearing :',
			json[0].metadata.avatars[0].avatar.wearables
		)
		console.log('player owns :', json[0].metadata.avatars[0].inventory)
	} catch {
		console.log('an error occurred while reaching for player data')
	}
}

fetchPlayerData()
```

### Deprecated player data methods

To obtain information from the current player that's running the scene, use `getUserData()`.

The example below imports the `~system/UserIdentity` namespace and runs `getUserData()`.

```ts
import { getUserData } from '~system/UserIdentity'

executeTask(async () => {
	let userData = await getUserData({})
	console.log(userData.data)
})
```

You can obtain data from other players that are nearby, by calling `getPlayerData()`, passing the id of a Decentraland account.

```ts
import { getPlayerData } from '~system/Players'

executeTask(async () => {
	let userData = await getPlayerData({ userId: '0x‚Ä¶.' })
	console.log(userData)
})
```

Both `getUserData()` and `getPlayerData()` return the same data structure available via the content API. See [Data from any player](#data-from-any-player)

`getPlayerData()` can only fetch data from players who are currently nearby. They don't have to be necessarily standing in the same scene, but in visual range, that's because this information is being fetched from the local engine that's rendering these avatars. To try this out in preview, open a second tab and log in with a different account.

{{< hint warning >}}
**üìî Note**: User IDs must always be lowercase. If copying a wallet address, make sure all the characters are set to lowercase.
{{< /hint >}}

<!--
To know what players are being rendered in the surroundings, use `getConnectedPlayers()`. This function returns an array with the ids of all the players that are currently being rendered, which are all eligible to call with `getPlayerData()`. You can pair this with listening for new players connecting and disconnecting by using `onPlayerConnectedObservable` and `onPlayerDisconnectedObservable`.

```ts
import { getConnectedPlayers } from '~system/Players'

// Get already connected players
executeTask(async () => {
	let connectedPlayers = await getConnectedPlayers({})
	connectedPlayers.players.forEach((player) => {
		console.log('player is nearby: ', player.userId)
	})
})

// Event when player connects
onPlayerConnectedObservable.add((player) => {
	console.log('player entered: ', player.userId)
})

// Event when player disconnects
onPlayerDisconnectedObservable.add((player) => {
	console.log('player left: ', player.userId)
})
```

{{< hint warning >}}
**üìî Note** : `onPlayerConnectedObservable` and `onPlayerDisconnectedObservable` will be deprecated on future versions of the SDK.
{{< /hint >}}

As an alternative, you can use `getPlayersInScene()` to only fetch the players that are standing within the scene boundaries and also being rendered. You can pair this with listening to new players entering and leaving the scene by using `onEnterSceneObservable` and `onLeaveSceneObservable`.

```ts
import { getPlayersInScene } from '~system/Players'

// Get all players already in scene
executeTask(async () => {
	let connectedPlayers = await getPlayersInScene({})
	connectedPlayers.players.forEach((player) => {
		console.log('player is nearby: ', player.userId)
	})
})

// Event when player enters scene
onEnterSceneObservable.add((player) => {
	console.log('player entered scene: ', player.userId)
})

// Event when player leaves scene
onLeaveSceneObservable.add((player) => {
	console.log('player left scene: ', player.userId)
})
```

{{< hint info >}}
**üí° Tip**: Read more about `onPlayerConnectedObservable` and `onPlayerDisconnectedObservable` in [Player connects or disconnects]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/interactivity/event-listeners.md#player-connects-or-disconnects">}}) and about about `onEnterSceneObservable` and `onLeaveSceneObservable` in [Player enters or leaves scene]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/interactivity/event-listeners.md#player-enters-or-leaves-scene">}}).

##¬†Player data components

Instead of using `players.getPlayerData()`, you can read data directly from a series of components that store the data on each player entity. The following components exist:

- `PlayerIdentityData`: Stores the player address and an `isGuest` property to flag guest accounts.
- `AvatarBase`: Stores data about the base avatar, including:
  - `name`: The player's name.
  - `bodyShapeUrn`: The ids corresponding to male or female body type.
  - `skinColor`: Player skin color as a `Color4`
  - `eyeColor`: Player eye color as a `Color4`
  - `hairColor`: Player hair color as a `Color4`
- `AvatarEquippedData`: The list of equipped wearables and emotes.
  - `wearable_urns`: The list of wearables that the player currently has equipped.
  - `emotes_urns`: The list of emotes that the player currently has equipped in the quick access wheel.

```ts
for (const [entity, data, base, attach, transform] of engine.getEntitiesWith(
	PlayerIdentityData,
	AvatarBase,
	AvatarEquippedData,
	Transform
)) {
	console.log('PLAYER DATA: ', { entity, data, transform, base, attach })
}
```

{{< hint warning >}}
**üìî Note**: All of these components are read-only. You cannot change their values from the scene.
{{< /hint >}}

## Get Portable Experiences

Portable experiences are essentially scenes that are not constrained to parcels of land. Players can carry these with them anywhere they go in Decentraland, adding a new layer of content over the world. Smart Wearables are examples of portable experiences. You may want to know if a player is wearing one of these, since a smart wearable may enable players to have abilities that could be considered cheating in a competitive game. For example, in a platform game, a player that wears a jetpack has a very unfair advantage over others.

As a scene creator, you may want to limit what players wearing portable experiences can do in your scene. Use `getPortableExperiencesLoaded()` to check if the player has any portable experiences currently activated.

```ts
import { getPortableExperiencesLoaded } from '~system/PortableExperiences'

executeTask(async () => {
	let portableExperiences = await getPortableExperiencesLoaded({})
	console.log(portableExperiences.loaded)
})
```

`getPortableExperiencesLoaded()` returns an array of objects, each of these objects includes an `id` attribute. In the case of wearables, the id is the wearable's URN.

## Get detailed info about a player's wearables

The `players.getPlayerData()` function returns only a list of wearable ids, without information about each wearable. Maybe you want to check for any wearable of a specific category (eg: hats), or any wearable of a specific rarity (eg: Mythic), for that you'll need to fetch more detailed information about the player's wearables.

Make a [REST API call]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/networking/network-connections.md#call-a-rest-api">}}) to the following URL, to obtain a full updated list of all wearables that are currently usable, with details about each.

`${playerRealm.realmInfo.baseUrl}/lambdas/collections/wearables-by-owner/${userData.userId}?includeDefinitions`

{{< hint warning >}}
**üìî Note**: To construct this URL, you must obtain the realm (likely with with `getRealm()`) and the player's id (likely with `getUserData()`)
{{< /hint >}}

This feature could be used together with fetching info about the player, to for example only allow players to enter a place if they are wearing any wearable from the halloween collection, or any wearable that is of _legendary_ rarity.

{{< hint info >}}
**üí° Tip**: Try the URL out in a browser to see how the response is structured.
{{< /hint >}}

```ts
import { getUserData } from '~system/UserIdentity'
import { getRealm } from '~system/Runtime'

async function fetchWearablesData() {
	try {
		let player = await getUserData({})
		const realm = await getRealm({})

		const url =
			`${realm.realmInfo?.baseUrl}/lambdas/collections/wearables-by-owner/${userData.userId}?includeDefinitions`.toString()
		console.log('using URL: ', url)

		let response = await fetch(url)
		let json = await response.json()

		console.log('full response: ', json)
	} catch {
		console.log('an error occurred while reaching for wearables data')
	}
}

executeTask(fetchWearablesData)
```

## Check the player's camera mode

Players can either be using a 1st or 3rd person camera when exploring Decentraland. Check which of these the player is using by checking the value `CameraMode` component of the `engine.CameraEntity` entity.

```ts
function checkCameraMode() {
	if (!Transform.has(engine.CameraEntity)) return

	let cameraEntity = CameraMode.get(engine.CameraEntity)

	if (cameraEntity.mode == CameraType.CT_THIRD_PERSON) {
		console.log('The player is using the 3rd person camera')
	} else {
		console.log('The player is using the 1st person camera')
	}
}

engine.addSystem(checkCameraMode)
```

{{< hint warning >}}
**üìî Note**: Camera information is only available for the current player running the scene. You can't query for the camera data of any other player.
{{< /hint >}}

The camera mode uses a value from the `CameraType` enum. The following values are possible:

- `CameraType.CT_FIRST_PERSON`
- `CameraType.CT_THIRD_PERSON`

The `CameraMode` component of the `engine.CameraEntity` is read-only, you can't force the player to change camera mode through this.

{{< hint info >}}
**üí° Tip**: To change the player's camera mode, use a [Camera modifier area]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/interactivity/avatar-modifiers.md#camera-modifiers">}}).
{{< /hint >}}

Knowing the camera mode can be very useful to fine-tune the mechanics of your scene to better adjust to what's more comfortable using this mode. For example, small targets are harder to click when in 3rd person.

{{< hint warning >}}
**üìî Note**: Avoid referring to the `engine.CameraEntity` on the initial scene loading, because that can result in errors if the entity is not initialized yet. To avoid this problem, encapsulate the behavior in an async [`executeTask` block]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/programming-patterns/async-functions.md#the-executetask-function" >}}).

If you refer to this entity in a system, it will always be available, because the first execution of the system is called once the scene is already properly initialized.
{{< /hint >}}

## Check if the player has the cursor locked

Players can switch between two cursor modes: _locked cursor_ mode to control the camera or _unlocked cursor_ mode for moving the cursor freely over the UI.

Players unlock the cursor by clicking the _Right mouse button_ or pressing the _Esc_ key, and lock the cursor back by clicking anywhere in the screen.

Check the `PointerLock` component of the scene's [camera entity]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/architecture/entities-components.md#reserved-entities" >}}) to find out what the current cursor mode is.

```ts
executeTask(async () => {
	const isLocked = PointerLock.get(engine.CameraEntity).isPointerLocked
	console.log(isLocked)
})
```

The `PointerLock` component of the `engine.CameraEntity` is read-only, you can't force the player to lock or unlock the cursor.

{{< hint warning >}}
**üìî Note**: Avoid referring to the `engine.CameraEntity` on the initial scene loading, because that can result in errors if the entity is not initialized yet. To avoid this problem, encapsulate the behavior in an async [`executeTask` block]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/programming-patterns/async-functions.md#the-executetask-function" >}}).

If you refer to this entity in a system, it will always be available, because the first execution of the system is called once the scene is already properly initialized.
