You can make the player perform an animation as part of the scene's code. This can help provide more immersion, and it can also help communicate what other players are doing to each other. The avatar animations are seen both by the player (in 3rd person view) and any other players around.

Animations done by the player are overriden by the default locomotion animations, like walking and jumping. So animations played by the scene only play while the player is standing still. If the player walks or jumps, any animations are interrupted.

**ðŸ“” Note**: Players can only be animated if they already are standing inside the scene's bounds, not if they are on a neighboring scene. Portable experiences and smart wearables can play animations anywhere.

## Default animations

Use the `triggerEmote()` function ro run one of the default animations that players are able to play anywhere in Decentraland. This function takes a an object with a single property as an argument:

- `predefinedEmote`: A string name for an existing emote.

```ts
import { triggerEmote } from '~system/RestrictedActions'

const emoter = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(emoter, { position: Vector3.create(8, 0, 8) })
MeshRenderer.setBox(emoter)
MeshCollider.setBox(emoter)
pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
  {
    entity: emoter,
    opts: { button: InputAction.IA_POINTER, hoverText: 'Dance' },
  },
  () => {
    triggerEmote({ predefinedEmote: 'robot' })
  }
)
```

The following list covers some of the default emotes that are available to all players, all of these are valid values for the `predefinedEmote` field:

- `wave`
- `fistpump`
- `robot`
- `raiseHand`
- `clap`
- `money`
- `kiss`
- `tik`
- `hammer`
- `tektonik`
- `dontsee`
- `handsair`
- `shrug`
- `disco`
- `dab`
- `headexplode`

## Custom animations

Use the `triggerSceneEmote()` to make the player perform a custom animation, stored as a .glb file as part of the scene's asset. This function takes an object as an argument with the following arguments:

- `src`: A string with a path to the emote file.
- `loop`: If true, the animation will loop continuously until the player moves or the animation is stopped. False by default.

```ts
import { triggerSceneEmote } from '~system/RestrictedActions'

const emoter = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(emoter, { position: Vector3.create(8, 0, 8) })
MeshRenderer.setBox(emoter)
MeshCollider.setBox(emoter)
pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
  {
    entity: emoter,
    opts: { button: InputAction.IA_POINTER, hoverText: 'Make snowball' },
  },
  () => {
    triggerSceneEmote({ src: 'animations/Snowball_Throw.glb', loop: false })
  }
)
```

## Required permissions in smart wearables and portable experiences

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**: Permissions are only relevant in [portable experiences]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/projects/portable-experiences.md" >}}) and [smart wearables]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/projects/smart-wearables.md" >}}). Normal scenes (both in parcels or in Worlds) are free to use avatar animations and are not affected by permissions.
{{< /hint >}}

Smart wearables and portable experiences are only allowed to use this functionality if they add a corresponding permissions on the `scene.json` file. This applies to both predefined and custom animations. This is granted via the `ALLOW_TO_TRIGGER_AVATAR_EMOTE` permission.

```json
  "requiredPermissions": [
    "ALLOW_TO_TRIGGER_AVATAR_EMOTE"
  ],
```

See [Required permissions]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/projects/scene-metadata.md#required-permissions">}}) for more details.
