To make a button in your UI, create a `Button` UI element with the following properties:

- `value`: A string with the text to display on the button.
- `onMouseDown`: A callback function that runs every time the user pushes the pointer button on the entity.
- `uiTransform`: Positioning properties of the UI element.

The following example shows how to create a clickable UI button.

_**ui.tsx file:**_
```tsx
import { Button } from '@dcl/sdk/react-ecs'

export const uiMenu = () => (
	<Button
		value="Click me"
		uiTransform={{ width: 100, height: 100 }}
		onMouseDown={() => {
			console.log('Clicked on the UI')
		}}
	/>
)
```

_**index.ts file:**_
```ts
import { ReactEcsRenderer } from '@dcl/sdk/react-ecs'
import { uiMenu } from './ui'

export function main() {
    ReactEcsRenderer.setUiRenderer(uiMenu)
}
```

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**: All the following snippets in this page assume that you have a `.ts` similar to the above, running the `ReactEcsRenderer.setUiRenderer()` function.
{{< /hint >}}


You can also write the function that is executed by the click outside the UI definition, and reference it by name. This helps keep the UI code more readable, and is also useful if multiple clickable UI entities need to call the same function.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@dcl/sdk/react-ecs'

function handleClick() {
	// Do something onClick
	console.log('Clicked on the UI')
}
export const uiMenu = () => (
	<Button
		value="Click me"
		uiTransform={{ width: 100 }}
		onMouseDown={{ handleClick }}
	/>
)
```

The following fields can be added to a `Button` UI element:

- `onMouseDown`: A callback function that runs every time the user pushes the pointer button on the entity.
- `onMouseUp`: A callback function that runs every the pointer button is raised while pointing at the entity.
- `onMouseEnter`: A callback function that runs every time the pointer starts hovering over the button.
- `onMouseLeave`: A callback function that runs every time the pointer stops hovering over the button.
- `color`: Background color of the button.
- `font`: Font of the text on the button.
- `textAlign`: Alignment of the text inside the button
- `uiTransform`: Positioning properties of the UI element.
- `uiBackground`: Set the color or texture of the UI element.
- `variant`: Use this property to set the style of the button as one of the defaults. `primary` and `secondary` are available.
- `disabled`: Boolean to set a button disabled. When disabled is set to _true_, the `onMouseDown` and `onMouseUp` actions are no longer called. Also the `alpha` value of the color of both the text and the backgroun is halved, so the button is "grayed-out" and stands out less.

## Button styling

Set the variant to `primary` or `secondary` to take advantage of the default styling options for buttons. `primary` makes your button red with white text, `secondary` makes your button white with red text.

```tsx
import { UiEntity, Button, ReactEcs } from '@dcl/sdk/react-ecs'
import { Color4 } from '@dcl/sdk/math'

export const uiMenu = () => (
	<UiEntity
		uiTransform={{
			width: 500,
			height: 230,
			margin: '16px 0 8px 270px',
			padding: 4,
			alignSelf: 'center',
		}}
		uiBackground={{ color: Color4.Gray() }}
	>
		<Button
			value="Click Me"
			variant="primary"
			uiTransform={{ width: 80, height: 20, margin: 4 }}
			onMouseDown={() => {
				console.log('Clicked on the UI')
			}}
		/>
		<Button
			value="Click Me"
			variant="secondary"
			uiTransform={{ width: 80, height: 20, margin: 4 }}
			onMouseDown={() => {
				console.log('Clicked on the UI')
			}}
		/>
	</UiEntity>
)
```

You're also free to use all of the properties on background freely. You can also set a variant and then override some of its properties. This example uses the `primary` variant, but overrides the color to be green:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@dcl/sdk/react-ecs'
import { Color4 } from '@dcl/sdk/math'

export const uiMenu = () => (
	<Button
		value="My Button!"
		variant="primary"
		uiTransform={{ width: 100, height: 100 }}
		onMouseDown={() => {
			console.log('Clicked on My Button!')
		}}
		uiBackground={{
			color: Color4.Green(),
		}}
	/>
)
```

## Togglable buttons

A common use case is to make a button toggle between two states, like a switch. The example below switches between two colors each time the button is pressed:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@dcl/sdk/react-ecs'
import { Color4 } from '@dcl/sdk/math'

let buttonEnabled = false

export const uiMenu = () => (
	<Button
		value="My Button"
		variant="primary"
		uiTransform={{ width: 100, height: 100 }}
		onMouseDown={() => {
			console.log('Clicked on My Button!')
			buttonEnabled = !buttonEnabled
			if (buttonEnabled) {
				// do something
			} else {
				// do something else
			}
		}}
		uiBackground={{
			color: buttonEnabled ? Color4.Green() : Color4.Red(),
		}}
	/>
)
```

Note that in the example above, the color depends on a `buttonEnabled` variable. Whenever this variable's value changes, it inmediately affects the background color.

## Hover Feedback

Another common use case is to display some kind of visual hint when hovering over a button, to clarify that this is interactible, or even to display a hover hint explaining what this button does. Use the `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` callbacks to detect when the player's cursor is on the button, and react accordingly.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@dcl/sdk/react-ecs'

let buttonEnabled = false

export const uiMenu = () => (
	<Button
		value="My Button"
		uiTransform={{ width: 100, height: 100 }}
		onMouseDown={() => {
			// button function
		}}
		onMouseEnter={() => {
			// show hint
		}}
		onMouseLeave={() => {
			// hide hint
		}}
	/>
)
```

## Making other elements clickable

Any element in the UI can be made clickable by adding an `onMouseDown` property to it, it works identically to a button. The following example adds `onMouseDown` properties to background images and text.

```tsx
import { UiEntity, ReactEcs } from '@dcl/sdk/react-ecs'
import { Color4 } from '@dcl/sdk/math'

export const uiMenu = () => (
	<UiEntity
		onMouseDown={() => {
			console.log('Background clicked!')
		}}
		uiTransform={{
			width: 400,
			height: 230,
		}}
		uiBackground={{ color: Color4.create(0.5, 0.8, 0.1, 0.6) }}
	>
		<Label
			onMouseDown={() => {
				console.log('Label clicked!')
			}}
			value={`Player: ${getPlayerPosition()}`}
			fontSize={18}
			uiTransform={{ width: '100%', height: 30 }}
		/>
	</UiEntity>
)
```

## Pointer blocking

All UI entities are non-pointer blocking by default, meaning that players's clicks will go through them and interact with objects in the 3D world space behind them. If an entity has an `onMouseDown` callback, then it becomes pointer blocking, so player's clicks don't affect what's behind that UI entity.

You can change this default behavior by changing the value of the `pointerFilter` property on the `uiTransform` component on any UI entity. For example to set an entity that has no `onMouseDown` to be pointer blocking.

The supported values for `pointerFilter` are:

- `block`: The UI element is pointer blocking, players can't click on anything behind this UI element.
- `none`: The UI element is non-pointer blocking. The element is not clickable and anything behind it can be clicked.

Below is a simple UI that doesn't have an `onMouseDown`, but that is overrides the default behavior of not being pointer-blocking by setting `pointerFilter` to `block`.

```tsx
import { UiEntity, ReactEcs } from '@dcl/sdk/react-ecs'
import { Color4 } from '@dcl/sdk/math'

// draw UI
export const uiMenu = () => (
	<UiEntity
		uiTransform={{
			width: '100%',
			height: '100px',
			pointerFilter: `block`,
		}}
		uiText={{ value: `This element is pointer blocking`, fontSize: 40 }}
		uiBackground={{ color: Color4.create(0.5, 0.8, 0.1, 0.6) }}
	/>
)
```
