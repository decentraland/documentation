The Decentraland SDK is a powerful tool that lets you create or enhance your scenes by writing code in Typescript (Javascript + Types).

{{< hint info >}}
**💡 Tip**: If you prefer to create your scenes with only no-code tools, see [Scene Editor]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/about-editor.md" >}}).
{{< /hint >}}

This tutorial walks you through how to get set up, and shows you the basic concepts for writing code in a Decentraland scene.

## Install the Creator Hub

The Creator Hub allows you to build, preview and deploy Decentraland scenes.

Visit the [Create page in Decentraland.org](https://decentraland.org/create/) and download the **Creator Hub**.

To edit your scene's code, you must also install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), if you don't have it already.

Read [Installation guide]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/editor-installation.md" >}}) for more details about installing the Creator Hub.

## Create your first scene

To create your first scene, follow these steps.

1. Open the Creator Hub.
2. Select the **Scenes** tab, and click **Create Scene**.

   <img src="/images/editor/create-scene.png" width="150" alt="Scene name"/>

3. You can then pick between different starting templates. For this exercise, pick the **Empty Scene**.

This step may take a couple of minutes. It populates your folder with the default set of files for a basic scene.

Once that's done, you'll see the empty grid of your scene.

## Add items from the asset packs

Explore the **Asset packs** on the bottom section of the Scene Editor, drop in a couple of items and adjust their positions. For the sake of this tutorial, any items will do for now.

<img src="/images/editor/asset-packs.png" alt="Scene name"/>

To place an item, click and drag it in from the asset pack menu into a location on your scene in the canvas.

<img src="/images/editor/drop-item.gif" width="300" alt="Scene name"/>

Already placed item can be clicked and dragged to reposition them freely. See [Scene editor essentials]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/scene-editor-essentials.md#position-items" >}}) for more details.

{{< hint info >}}
**💡 Tip**: Cover the entire scene with a ground item. Items of type **Ground** have a paint bucket icon on them. If you drag one of these into your scene, it covers all of your scene's ground with copies of this item.

<img src="/images/editor/ground.png" width="500" />
{{< /hint >}}

## Run a preview

Click the **Preview** button on the top menu to load your scene inside Decentraland. You can now explore the scene as a Decentraland avatar.

<!-- TODO: screenshot -->

<!-- <img src="/images/editor/preview-button.png" width="150" alt="Scene name"/> -->

Read more about the scene preview in [preview a scene]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/getting-started/preview-scene.md" >}}).

## Custom 3D assets

Download this 3D model of an avocado in _glb_ format from the following [link](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/avocado/raw/main/avocado-glb.zip) and unzip it.

![](/images/media/avocado.jpg)

1. Click the plus sign on the top-right corner of the Asset Packs section of the Scene Editor UI.

2. Drag the **avocado.glb** file onto the region on the Scene Editor UI and click **Import**.

   <img src="/images/editor/import-avocado.png" width="500" />

You can now find the **avocado.glb** model in the **Local Assets** tab, inside the **Scene** folder. From there you can drag it onto your scene, like with any item from the Asset Packs.

   <img src="/images/editor/avocado-in-local-assets.png" width="500" />

## Edit the scene code

The next sections describe how you can edit your scene's code, giving you far more freedom as a creator.

Click the **<> Code** button on the top menu to open your scene project on Visual Studio Code.

<img src="/images/editor/code-button.png" width="200"/>

{{< hint warning >}}
**📔 Note**: Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), if you don't have it already.
{{< /hint >}}

This opens a separate window with Visual Studio Code. On the left margin you can navigate the files and folder structure of your project.

<img src="/images/editor/files-on-vs-studio.png" alt="Scene name" width="200"/>

Open the `index.ts` file from inside the `src` folder in your scene. Its content should look like this:

```ts
import {} from '@dcl/sdk/math'
import { engine } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

export function main() {}
```

The first two lines deal with `import` statements. These hold references to things that are defined on other files, so they can be used in this file. You won't need to deal with these lines directly in this tutorial, but notice that the list of imports being referenced will grow as you write your code.

Notice that this file defines a function called `main()`. This function is the entry point to the scene, any code you want the scene to run when it fist loads needs to either be inside this function or to be indirectly called by what's inside this function.

In the previous section we mentioned how you can easily drag the custom avocado 3D model into your scene in a no-code way. Now we'll see how to achieve the same by writing code.

Replace the full contents of your `index.ts` file for the following. These lines expand the `main()` function and add a couple of imports:

```ts
import { Vector3 } from '@dcl/sdk/math'
import { engine, Transform, GltfContainer } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

export function main() {
	// create a fresh new Entity
	let avocado = engine.addEntity()

	// give it a Transform
	Transform.create(avocado, {
		position: Vector3.create(3, 1, 3),
	})

	// give it a GLTF
	GltfContainer.create(avocado, {
		src: 'assets/scene/avocado.glb',
	})
}
```

<!-- If you had the scene preview already running, close it. Then open the preview once again to see that the 3D model is now there too. -->

<!-- TODO: screenshot -->

<!-- ![](/images/media/avocado.jpg) -->

The lines you just added create a new [entity]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/architecture/entities-components.md" >}}), give it a [shape]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/shape-components.md" >}}) based on the 3D model you downloaded, and [set its position and scale]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/entity-positioning.md" >}}) via the **Transform**.

## Add interactivity

To make your scene more engaging, let's make the entities in the scene respond to the player's interactions.

Inside the `main()` function, add a pointer event handler to the avocado entity. This executes a custom function every time that the player clicks on the avocado.

```ts
pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
	{
		entity: avocado,
		opts: { button: InputAction.IA_POINTER, hoverText: 'Collect' },
	},
	function () {
		console.log('CLICKED AVOCADO')
	}
)
```

{{< hint info >}}
**💡 Tip**: Visual Studio Code helps you by marking syntax errors, autocompleting while you write and even showing smart suggestions that depend on context. Also click on an object to see the full definition of its class.

If any of the words you pasted are underlined in red, hover over them to see if VS Studio offers an easy solution. You'll likely have to do this for **pointerEventsSystem**, and **InputAction**.

Clicking the lightbulb will suggest `Update import from @dcl/sdk/ecs`. Select this option to add imports to the start of your `index.ts` file to these components.
{{< /hint >}}

The `pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown()` statement requires defining three things:

- What `entity` to work on.
- An `opts` object with additional parameters, that optionally include things like what button to use and what hint text to display.
- A function, that will be called every time the entity is interacted with

In this case, the function we're calling has a single line and simply prints some text to the console.

```ts
console.log('CLICKED AVOCADO')
```

In the `opts` section, we're setting the `button` field so that it listens to the pointer button (the left-mouse button on a PC). We're also setting the `hoverText` parameter to display custom text. That way players will read the text "collect" when they hover their cursor over the avocado, and they'll know what will happen if they click on it. The avocado doesn't do much just yet, but we'll get there in the next steps.

   <!--
   TODO: how to see CONSOLE
  To read the message that is printed to the console:
 -->

{{< hint warning >}}
**📔 Note**: For an entity to be clickable, it must have a collider geometry. The model used here already includes one. See the [Colliders]({{< ref "/content/creator/3d-modeling/colliders.md" >}}) section for workarounds for models that don't include a collider geometry.
{{< /hint >}}

Now let's make that click function do something more interesting, let's make the avocado vanish. Use `engine.removeEntity()` to get rid of the avocado once it's clicked. Let's add an extra line to our snippet:

```ts
pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
	{
		entity: avocado,
		opts: { button: InputAction.IA_POINTER, hoverText: 'Collect' },
	},
	function () {
		console.log('CLICKED AVOCADO')
		engine.removeEntity(avocado)
	}
)
```

Now when clicked, the avocado ceases to exist in the scene.

## Tweens

Tweens describe a gradual transition from one position/rotation/scale to another, over a period of time.

Let's start by adding a scale tween to our avocado, just to try out the feature. Add the following lines at the end of the `main()` function, without changing anything of what you already added:

```ts
export function main() {
	// (...)
	// create avocado
	// pointer events

	Tween.create(avocado, {
		mode: Tween.Mode.Move({
			start: Vector3.create(3, 1, 3),
			end: Vector3.create(8, 1, 8),
		}),
		duration: 5000,
		easingFunction: EasingFunction.EF_LINEAR,
	})
}
```

The `Tween` component we created has arguments that make it change position, from a position on the coordinates _3,1,3_ of the scene, to the coordinates _8,1,8_, over a period of 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds). This tween will run as soon as the scene starts

A `Tween` component requires the following information:

- `entity`: What entity to work on
- `start`: Starting position.
- `end`: Ending position.
- `duration`: Duration (in milliseconds) of start to end scaling.
- `easingFunction`: What kind of curve to use to control the rate of change over time. In this case we use linear, which results in a smooth constant change.

We can play around with the `easingFunction` parameter to get some interesting effects. For example we can instead use `EF_EASEINBOUNCE` to perform the transition using an ease-in bounce interpolation, which starts with a bouncy effect and then goes from slow to fast.

{{< hint info >}}
**💡 Tip**: You can also use the **Tween** component to scale or rotate an entity over a period of time, this is a really useful tool! Learn more [here]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/move-entities.md" >}})
{{< /hint >}}

## Using your own functions

In this section we'll add another tween on the Avocado's scale, to make the vanishing effect look more appealing. But we'll take a slightly less direct approach to introduce some other concepts.

The simplest way to have our avocado shrink when we click on it would be to add our tween inside the pointer function, replacing the line we currently have to delete the Entity. But instead, let's define this tween in a generic way in a separate function. That way, we can reuse this same function on other items too, and won't need to write the same code twice! Our new function will be separate from `main()`, but don't worry, we'll be calling it from main soon.

```ts
function collect(myEntity: Entity) {
	Tween.createOrReplace(myEntity, {
		mode: Tween.Mode.Scale({
			start: Vector3.One(),
			end: Vector3.Zero(),
		}),
		duration: 500,
		easingFunction: EasingFunction.EF_EASEINBOUNCE,
	})
}
```

Notice that instead of adding the tween to our avocado entity directly, our function takes in a parameter named `myEntity`, of type `Entity`. This means you could run this function on any entity in the scene, and apply the same `Tween` to it. More on that later.

{{< hint info >}}
**💡 Tip**: Whenever there's code you might be using multiple times in your scene, it's a good practice to put it inside a function. That way you only have to write it once, and it's easier to maintain.
{{< /hint >}}

Here we created a Tween that affects the _Scale_, so now `start` and `end` refer to the size of the avocado. It goes from a size of one to zero, performs the tween over a duration of 500 milliseconds (half a second), and uses an `EASEINBOUNCE` easing function, that gives it a fun bouncy effect.

Also notice that this time we add the `Tween` component using `Tween.createOrReplace()`, instead of just `Tween.create()`. This is because the entity might already have a tween on it, and there can only be one on any entity. For example, the player might click the avocado while it's still moving from the Tween that we first wrote.

Now let's modify the function we wrote for when we click on the avocado. Let's change the line that says `engine.removeEntity(avocado)`, and instead let's call the `collect()` function we just defined, passing a reference to our avocado entity:

```ts
pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
	{
		entity: avocado,
		opts: { button: InputAction.IA_POINTER, hoverText: 'Collect' },
	},
	function () {
		console.log('CLICKED AVOCADO')

		collect(avocado)
	}
)
```

If you now open the scene preview and click on the avocado, you should see it go away with style, performing a fun jumpy movement.

<!-- TODO: GIF -->

{{< hint warning >}}
**📔 Note**: You may have realized that now the avocado shrinks to a size of 0, but still exists. We won't cover this in this first tutorial, but in a real scenario you should make sure you delete the entity after the tween is over, to optimize your scene's performance. See [On tween finished][here]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/move-entities.md#on-tween-finished" >}}).
{{< /hint >}}

## Reference an item from the Scene Editor

Your code can also do things with the items you added visually in the Scene Editor. You can fetch these items by name in your code, using the function `engine.getEntityOrNullByName()`. Use the name for the item that you see written on the [entity tree]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/scene-editor-essentials.md#the-entity-tree" >}}).

In this example, we have an entity named **Yellow Crate**. You can use any item you want, just make sure you write its name exactly as on the entity tree.

{{< hint info >}}
**💡 Tip**: You can rename entities by doing right-clicking and selecting **Rename** on the entity on the entity tree.
{{< /hint >}}

<img src="/images/editor/asset-packs.png" alt="Scene name"/>

```ts
export function main() {
	// Avocado stuff

	const crate = engine.getEntityOrNullByName('Yellow Crate')

	if (crate) {
		console.log('The crate exists')
	}
}
```

In the snippet above, we use `engine.getEntityOrNullByName()` to fetch a reference to an entity named _Yellow Crate_. In the next line, we do `if (crate)` to ensure that there really is an entity by this name in the scene. If there isn't one, then the value of `crate` will be `null`. See [Combine with code]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/smart-items/combine-with-code.md" >}}) for more info.

{{< hint info >}}
**💡 Tip**: All entities added via the Scene Editor are already be loaded into your scene before the `main()` function is called. You should be able to reference them in this function, or other functions called by it.
{{< /hint >}}

Now let's add a pointer behavior our Yellow Crate entity, just like we did with the avocado.

```ts
export function main() {
	// Avocado stuff

	const crate = engine.getEntityOrNullByName('Yellow Crate')

	if (crate) {
		console.log('The crate exists')

		pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
			{
				entity: crate,
				opts: { button: InputAction.IA_POINTER, hoverText: 'Collect' },
			},
			function () {
				console.log('CLICKED AVOCADO')
				collect(crate)
			}
		)
	}
}
```

Notice how we're calling the `collect()` function that we defined before. Since the function is defined separately, we only needed to write one line to call it!

{{< hint info >}}
**💡 Tip**: You can also fetch [Smart Items]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/smart-items/smart-items.md" >}}) from your scene in the same way, and do whatever you want with them via code. See [Combine with code]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/smart-items/combine-with-code.md" >}}) for more info.
