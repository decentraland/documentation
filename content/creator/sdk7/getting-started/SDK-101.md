The Decentraland SDK is a powerful tool that lets you create scenes by writing in Typescript (Javascript + Types).

This mini-tutorial walks you through how to get set up, and shows you the basic parts of a Decentraland scene.


## Install the editor

The Decentraland Editor is a Visual Studio extension, that allows you to build, preview and deploy Decentraland scenes.

To install the Decentraland Editor:

1) Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), if you don't have it already.

2) Open Visual Studio Code, and open the extensions marketplace. Search for the **Decentraland Editor SDK7** extension and click **Install**. You'll then need to restart Visual Studio to use the extension.

Read [Installation guide]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/getting-started/installation-guide.md" >}}) for more details about installing the Editor.



## Create your first scene

To create your first scene using the Decentraland Editor, follow these steps.

Make sure you've [installed the Decentraland editor]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/getting-started/installation-guide.md" >}}), then:

1) Open a Visual Studio Code window on an _empty folder_.
2) Select the Decentraland tab on Visual Studio's left margin sidebar
3) Click **Create Project**
<!-- 4) The editor will prompt you about what kind of project to create. Select **Scene**. -->


This step may take a couple of minutes. It populates your folder with the default set of files for a basic scene.

Once that's done, you can preview the 3D scene by clicking **Run Scene** in the Decentraland tab of Visual Studio Code.

Read more about the scene preview in [preview a scene]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/getting-started/preview-scene.md" >}}).


## Edit the scene

Open the `src/index.ts` file from your scene folder.

Change anything you want from this code, for example change the _x_ position of the first `cube` entity that's spawned (on line 20). If you kept the preview running in an open tab, you should now see the changes show in the preview.

**💡 Tip**:   Visual Studio Code helps you by marking syntax errors, autocompleting while you write and even showing smart suggestions that depend on context. Also click on an object to see the full definition of its class.

Download this 3D model of an avocado in _glTF_ format from the following [link](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/avocado/raw/main/Avocado.zip).

![](/images/media/avocado.jpg)

Create a new folder under your scene’s directory named `/models`. Extract the downloaded file and place all of its contents in that folder. Note that there are several files that make up the 3D model, all of them must be in the same path.

In Visual Studio Code, navigate to the `/models` folder and select the `avocado.gltf` model. You'll see a tab opens to preview what the 3D model looks like.

At the end of your scene’s `index.ts` file, add the following lines:

```ts
let avocado = engine.addEntity()

GltfContainer.create(avocado, {src: "models/Avocado.gltf"})

Transform.create(avocado, {
	  position:  Vector3.create(3, 1, 3),
	  scale: Vector3.create(30, 30, 30)
	})
```

{{< hint info >}}
**💡 Tip**:   If any of the words you pasted are underlined in red, hover over them to see if VS Studio offers an easy solution. In this case clicking the lightbulb will suggest `Update import from @dcl/sdk/ecs`. Select this option to import these components into your scene.
{{< /hint >}}

If you had the scene preview already running, close it. Then open the preview once again to see that the 3D model is now there too.

![](/images/media/avocado.jpg)

The lines you just added create a new [entity]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/architecture/entities-components.md" >}}), give it a [shape]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/shape-components.md" >}}) based on the 3D model you downloaded, and [set its position and scale]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/entity-positioning.md" >}}).

Note that the cubes in your scene all rotate smoothly, but not the avocado you just added. That's because a [system]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/architecture/systems.md" >}}) named `circularSystem` that comes defined in this template in the `systems.ts` file is running. This system runs a function on every frame (30 times a second). This system in particular tells every entity that has both a `MeshRenderer` and a `Transform` component in the scene to rotate just a tiny bit, once per frame. Your avocado model doesn't have a `MeshRenderer` component, so it's not affected by this system. If you delete or comment out the code for this system, all entities stop rotating.

## Add interactivity

To make your scene more engaging, make the entities in the scene respond to the player's interactions.

1. Add a pointer event handler. This executes a provided function every time that the player clicks on the avocado.

	```ts
	pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
		avocado, 
		()=>{
			console.log("CLICKED AVOCADO")
		}, 
		{
			button: InputAction.IA_POINTER
			hoverText: "Collect"
		}
	)
	```

	The `pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown` statement requires defining three things:
	* What entity to work on
	* A function, that will be called every time the entity is interacted with
	* An object with additional parameters, that optionally include things like what button to use and what hint text to display.

	In this case, the function we're calling is simply logging the text "CLICKED AVOCADO" to the console.

	In the parameters section, we're setting the `button` field so that it listens to the pointer button (the left-mouse button on a PC). We're also adding an extra `hoverText` parameter to display a custom text in the hover hint. That way players will read the text "collect" when they hover their cursor over the avocado, and they'll know what will happen if they click on it (the avocado doesn't do much just yet, but we'll get there in the next steps).

	To read the message that is printed to the console: 

	* If running the preview in VS Studio Code, open **View > Output**. The tab might already be open on the lower section of the screen.  
	* If running the preview on a Chrome browser, go to **View > Developer > Javascript console**.
	
2. Make the avocado vanish. Use `engine.removeEntity()` to get rid of the avocado once its clicked.

	```ts
	pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
		avocado,
		() => {
			console.log("CLICKED AVOCADO")
			engine.removeEntity(avocado)
		},
		{ 
			button: InputAction.IA_POINTER,
			hoverText: "Collect"
		}
	)
	```

	Now when clicked, the avocado ceases to exist in the scene.

## The SDK Utils library

The Decentraland SDK Utils library includes a number of helper functions and specialized components that make it easier to carry out a lot of common use cases.

To use any of the helpers provided by the SDK Utils library:

1. Install it as a dependency of your scene. At the bottom of the Decentraland tab, in Visual Studio Code, click the **+** icon on the **Dependencies** section. Then write the name of the dependency you wish to install:

	`@dcl-sdk/utils`

	The UI will then ask you if this is a Decentraland dependency. Select **Yes**.

2. Add this line at the start of your `index.ts` file, or any other file that needs to use it:

	`import * as utils from "@dcl-sdk/utils"`

3. Further down in the, write `utils.` and let the suggestions show the available helpers. You’ll see there are a number of functions you can run and of components that can be added to entities.


Let's make the interaction with the avocado a little more engaging:


4. Use this function from the SDK Utils library on your avocado entity, to make it slowly shrink. The provided arguments make it change scale from a scale of 30 to a scale of a over a period of 2 seconds:

```ts
utils.tweens.startScaling(avocado,
	Vector3.create(30, 30, 30),
	Vector3.create(1, 1, 1),
	2
)
```
The `utils.tweens.startScaling` function requires the following parameters:

	* `entity`: What entity to work on
	* `start`: Starting scale.
  * `end`: Ending scale.
  * `duration`: Duration (in seconds) of start to end scaling.

> TIP: Your code editor will hint this information to you once you typed `utils.tweens.startScaling(`.

5. Instead of having the avocado shrink on its own when the scene starts, replace the function called by the pointer events handler, so that it performs the shrinking action instead of removing the entity from the engine.

	```ts
	pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
		avocado,
		() => {
			console.log("CLICKED AVOCADO")
			utils.tweens.startScaling(avocado,
				Vector3.create(30, 30, 30),
				Vector3.create(1, 1, 1),
				2
			)
		},
		{
			button: InputAction.IA_POINTER,
			hoverText: "Collect"
		}
	)
	```

6. Notice that the `utils.tweens.startScaling` function also takes two other optional more advanced parameters that you can play around with:

  * `interpolationType`: What kind of curve to use to control the rate of change over time. By default linear, which results in a smooth constant change.
	* `onFinishCallback`: A function that is called when the transition finishes.


	```ts
	pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
		avocado,
		() => {
			console.log("CLICKED AVOCADO")
			utils.tweens.startScaling(avocado,
				Vector3.create(30, 30, 30),
				Vector3.create(1, 1, 1),
				2,
				utils.InterpolationType.EASEOUTEBOUNCE,
				() => {
					console.log("FINISHED")
					engine.removeEntity(avocado)
				},
			)
		},
		{
			button: InputAction.IA_POINTER,
			hoverText: "Collect"
		}
	)
	```

	The fourth parameter tells the component to perform the transition using an ease-out bounce interpolation, which results in a speed curve that goes from fast to slow and ends with a bouncy effect.

	The final parameter, calls a very simple function prints the text "FINISHED" to the console once the transition is over, and also removes the avocado from the engine as we were doing before.

## 3D Art Assets

A good experience will have great 3D art to go with it. If you're keen on creating those 3D models yourself, you're encouraged to, see the [3D Modeling section of our docs](/creator/3d-modeling/3d-models) for more info. But if you prefer to focus on the coding or game design side of things, you don't need to create your own assets!

Here are a few tips to get great 3D models that you can use in a Decentraland scene:

- Build a scene in the Decentraland [Builder](https://builder.decentraland.org) and export it, together with all its assets, to keep working on it with the SDK.
- [Asset Ovi](https://assetovi.com/)
- Download all the 3D assets available in the Builder from [this repo](https://github.com/decentraland/builder-assets/tree/master/assets)
- [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/)
- [Clara.io](https://clara.io/)
- [Archive3D](https://archive3d.net/)
- [SketchUp 3D Warehouse](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/)
- [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) (3D models made primarily for 3D printing, but adaptable to Virtual Worlds)
- [ShareCG](https://www.sharecg.com/)
- [CGTrader](https://CGTrader.com)

{{< hint warning >}}
**📔 Note**:  Models must be in the supported `.gltf` or `.glb` formats, and must have a number of triangles, textures and materials that adhere to the [scene limitations]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/optimizing/scene-limitations.md" >}}). If getting models from a third party site, pay attention to the licence restrictions that the content you download has.
{{< /hint >}}



## Publish your scene

If you own LAND, or have permissions given by someone that does, you can upload your scene to Decentraland. See [publishing]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/publishing/publishing.md" >}}).

If you don't own land, you can still upload your scene for free to third party services, so you can easily share your creations with others as a link. See [Deploy to third party]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/publishing/deploy-third-party.md" >}}).
