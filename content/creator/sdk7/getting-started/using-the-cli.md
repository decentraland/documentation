To create, preview, deploy and deal with a Decentraland scene you can either use 

- The Decentraland Editor
- The command line

Although the Editor is easier to use, using the command line allows you more flexibility, and can be easily used in automated processes.

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**:  The Editor runs the same command-line operations behind the curtains.

**ðŸ’¡ Tip**:  See [Instalation guide]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/getting-started/installation-guide.md" >}}) for instructions on how to install the Editor.

## Before you Begin

To deal with the scene via the command line, please install the following dependencies before you run CLI commands with the scene:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version 8 or later)

## Initiate a new project

Run `npx @dcl/sdk-commands init` on an empty folder to populate it with the default files of a Decentraland project.

The CLI then prompts you to chose what kind of project, if you want to build a [scene]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/projects/scene-metadata.md" >}}), a [workspace]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/projects/workspaces.md" >}}) or a [smart wearable]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/projects/smart-wearables.md" >}}). If selecting a scene, the CLI prompts you about what base project to use as a starting point.

## Update the SDK version of a scene

Run the following command on the scene folder:

```bash
npm i @dcl/sdk@latest
```

You can confirm that it worked by checking the `package.json` file for the scene, and looking for the `@dcl/sdk` version there.

## Run a preview

Run `npm run start` on the root level of a scene, workspace, or smart wearable project to open a preview in a browser window.

See [preview scenes]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/getting-started/preview-scene.md" >}}) for details and special options when running a preview.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build your project. Decentraland scenes are written in TypeScript, but they are built to minified JavaScript when published. See [coding scenes]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/getting-started/coding-scenes.md" >}}) for more details.

The build command is optional, as it also runs in the background before deploying (although you can add a flag to skip it).

The build command runs more rigurous type checks than those that run with `npm run start`, running it can sometimes be helpful to debug a scene.

## Deploy a scene

Run `npm run deploy` to publish your scene to Decentraland. This command opens a browser window where you can sign with your wallet to authorize the deployment.

See [publishing]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/publishing/publishing.md" >}}) for details and special options when publishing a scene.



## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, see the [troubleshooting]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/debugging/troubleshooting.md" >}}) section.



<!--


#### Optional: Install Git

Mac OS and linux-based machines should have git installed by default, these steps should only be relevant to Windows based machines.

1.  Download [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (you'll likely want the 64-bit Windows version)
2.  The installation process will prompt you to choose severla options, we recommend the following:
	1.  Install **git bash**
	2.  For default text editor, select **Use the Nano editor by default**
	3.  For path environment, select **Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt**
	4.  For SSH executable, select **Use OpenSSH**
	5.  For HTTPS transport backend, select **Use the OpenSSL library**
	6.  For line ending conversions, select **Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings**
	7.  For the terminal emulator to use with Git Bash select **Use MinTTY**
	8.  On the final installation screen select the following options
		- **Enable file system caching**
		- **Enable Git Credential Manager**
		- **Enable symbolic links**
