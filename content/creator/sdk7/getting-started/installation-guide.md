## VS Code Extension

The Decentraland Visual Studio Code extension allows you to build, preview and deploy Decentraland scenes.

To install the Decentraland Visual Studio Code extension:

1. Install <img src="/images/editor/vscode.png" alt="Header" width="25"/> [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), if you don't have it already.

2. Open Visual Studio Code, and open the <img src="/images/editor/vscode-extensions.png" alt="Header" width="25"/> **extensions** marketplace.

3. Search for the <img src="/images/editor/dcl-logo.png" alt="Header" width="25"/> **Decentraland Editor SDK7** extension and click **Install**. You'll then need to restart Visual Studio to use the extension.

   {{< hint warning >}}
   **📔 Note**: There are two versions of the VS Code extension, the **Decentraland Editor SDK6** and the **Decentraland Editor SDK7**. As their names suggest, each version is meant for working on Decentraland scenes built with different SDK versions. You can have both extensions active in your same installation of Visual Studio Code, and use them accordingly depending on what project you're working with.

4. You'll then need to **restart Visual Studio** to use the extension.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, see the [troubleshooting]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/debugging/troubleshooting.md" >}}) section.
